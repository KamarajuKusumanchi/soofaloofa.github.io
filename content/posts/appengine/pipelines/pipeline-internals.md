[We've learned how to execute and chain together pipelines]({{< ref
"2015-05-12-app-engine-pipelines-part-two-connecting-pipelines.md" >}}),
now let's take a look at how pipelines execute under the hood. If necessary,
you can refer to the [source code of the pipelines
project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-pipelines) to
clarify any details.

## The Pipeline Data Model

Let's start with the pipeline data model. Note that each Kind defined by the
pipelines API is prefixed by `_AE_Pipeline`, making it easy to view individual
pipeline details by viewing the datastore entity.

### PipelineRecord

Every pipeline is represented by a *PipelineRecord* in the datastore. The
PipelineRecord records the pipeline's root identifier (if this pipeline is a
child), any child pipelines spawned by this pipeline, the current status
of the pipeline, and a few additional bookkeeping details.

At any point in time a Pipeline may be in one of four states: WAITING, RUN,
DONE, and ABORTED.  WAITING implies that this pipeline has a barrier that
must be satisfied before the pipeline can be RUN. RUN means that the pipeline
has been started. DONE means that the pipeline is complete. ABORTED means
that the pipeline has been manually aborted.

### SlotRecord

The output of a pipeline is represented as a *Slot* stored in the datastore as a
*SlotRecord*. When a pipeline completes, it stores its output in the SlotRecord
to be made available to further pipelines.

### BarrierRecord

A *BarrierRecord* represents the slots that must be filled before a pipeline can
execute. The barrier tracks *blocking_slots* that must be filled before the
barrier can be lifted. Once the barrier is lifted a *target* pipeline is
notified and the target can transition to the RUN state.

Barriers that depend on a slot being filled are stored in the *BarrierIndex*,
which tracks barriers that are dependent on a slot. The purpose of the
BarrierIndex is to force [strong consistency](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/articles/balancing-strong-and-eventual-consistency-with-google-cloud-datastore/) when querying for a SlotRecord's Barriers.

### StatusRecord

The *StatusRecord* tracks the current status of a pipeline and facilitates the
pipeline user interface. The StatusRecord is updated as the pipeline progresses
to give a view of the current pipeline state. Not much more than that.

## Pipeline Execution

Having an understanding of the pipeline data model gives a rough idea of how
pipelines are executed. Each stage of execution corresponds to a webapp2 handler
that services the request and advances the state of the pipeline. The following
diagram shows each of the pipeline stages during typical execution and the
description that follows provides more detail on each stage.

### start()

A pipeline is started by calling its `start()` method. When calling `start()` a
*PipelineRecord* is created and marked as a *RootPipeline*, *SlotRecords* are
created for each of the pipelines outputs and marked as children of the
pipeline, and *BarrierRecords* are created corresponding to each of the output
slots of the pipeline. Finally, a task is queued to the `/run` handler to
execute the pipeline.

### /run handler

The `/run` handler transitions the pipeline from the WAITING state to the RUN
state by setting a flag on the *PipelineRecord*, the pipeline object instance is
then reconstructed given the data from the request and the pipeline's `run()`
method is called. When the `run()` method is complete, any outputs are used to
fill *SlotRecords* and yielded to the parent pipeline when necessary.  Finally,
any child pipelines and their dependent slots and barriers are created and
marked as children of the parent pipeline. Calls to the `/fanout`
handler are made to queue tasks to start any child pipelines.

### /fanout handler

The `/fanout` handler loads all child pipelines given a parent pipeline and queues
a task to the `/run` handler for each of them.

### /output handler

Whenever a slot is filled a task is queued to the `/output` handler to notify any
barriers to a pipeline's execution that they can be removed. If a pipeline has
all its barriers to completing removed, a task is queued to the `/finalize` handler
to mark our pipeline as complete. The `/output` handler queues tasks to the
`/run` method for any pipelines that have their barriers to starting removed.

### /finalized handler

When the `/finalized` handler is called, the pipeline is marked as complete and
our pipeline's `finalized()` method is called.

## Conclusion

Understanding the Pipeline data model and run-time can help you to visualize and
debug any pipeline problems. Stay tuned for the next article covering
asynchronous pipelines.
