This morning I noticed that hovering over links in IE 9 causes slight mouse lag on low-powered computers.  The culprit?  A pop-up notification at the bottom left of the window displaying the link target.  The fix?  Permanently display the Status bar by right-clicking an open space to the right of the New tab button, and selecting Status bar.

Most computers would laugh at the prospect of rendering this insignificant detail but this otherwise lovely MSI Wind Nettop 100 couldn’t handle it.  Now it can.
