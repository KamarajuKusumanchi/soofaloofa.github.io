<p>I&#39;ve migrated the existing comments (and maybe lost a few) but haven&#39;t bothered to redirect any old posts to their new home. I&#39;m definitely starting fresh!</p>

Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-are-you-selling-">1. What are you selling?</h3>
<p>You need to clearly define what you are selling. This should get very specific and include any different versions or service levels of your product? Are you selling support? Are yo selling security? Think of the pain points of your customer and how what you are selling can alleviate this pain.</p>
<h3 id="2-who-are-you-selling-to-">2. Who are you  selling to?</h3>
<p>Are you selling to consumers or enterprise? Be specific. Is your offering for teachers or principals? Administrators? Try to define the most specific audience you can and then focus your marketing and sales efforts on exactly this audience.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-price-point-">3. What is the price point?</h3>
<p>The ideal answer to this question should come from your ideal customer. Find and reach out to the person or people you have identified in your first two questions and ask them -- What would you pay for a service like this? If you are marketing online try and include a survey and gather as much data as you can about possible price points.</p>
<h3 id="remember-your-goal">Remember your goal</h3>
<p>Throughout this exercise always remember to focus on your goal. The biggest marketing questions you need to ask are &quot;Who would buy this?&quot; followed by &quot;How do I find them?&quot;. If you can answer these two questions with marketing your sales channel and product will help close the deal.</p>

The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge. </p>
<h3 id="be-concise">Be concise</h3>
<p>The first criteria for the applications was describing your business idea in 100 words or less. 100 words is not a lot so you need to make sure every word counts. This ideal holds true for all writing (&quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/952396-not-a-wasted-word-this-has-been-a-main-point">Not a wasted word</a>&quot;). Every word must have purpose and every sentence must lead to your goal -- helping the reader understand exactly what it is you are trying to do. </p>
<h3 id="be-specific">Be specific</h3>
<p>For the technical portion of your application be sure to include concrete and actionable items that can help you achieve your goal. It&#39;s okay here to talk about more specific domain knowledge and use technical terms. You need to show that you have thought deeply about the problem and about how you can best solve it.</p>
<h3 id="be-realistic">Be realistic</h3>
<p>This advice may not apply to all applications and it would vary depending on your idea. In my case I chose a business idea that had a reasonable chance of making forward progress in the next year. At the very least you must provide some evidence that you are at the stage of your business where you are ready to start formalizing your plans and start working towards your goals.</p>
<h3 id="have-someone-proofread-your-work">Have someone proofread your work</h3>
<p>You absolutely <em>need</em> someone outside your immediate circle to proofread your work. Ideally this person would not know anything about your business or even about your problem domain. You must assume that the judges have never heard of your problem and know nothing about your area of expertise. This means you must educate them about what the problem is and how you are going to solve it using plain English. I was lucky enough to have my wife Manon, who has outstanding talent in grant and proposal writing, go over the application with a fine toothed comb. I cannot stress enough how much this helped me convey my idea in an understandable way.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already had our first workshop session and I&#39;ve learned a ton already.

I found a Chef cookbook to install node and after a bit of work have a cookbook that will install arbitrary node packages through npm.  I based this heavily on <a href="https://github.com/balbeko/chef-npm">balbeko</a>&#39;s chef-npm cookbook with modifications to accept a data bag list of npm packages. Any packages in this list will be installed by Chef.</p>

But to me the biggest and most important announcement was the new <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/googles-new-google-photo-features-15gb-full-size-storage-auto-highlight-auto-enhance-more/">Google+ photo features</a>. Full-size high-resolution photos, automatic highlights of entire albums, automatic enhancement and auto-awesome combine to make Google+ <em>the</em> most feature packed photo hosting service on the web. Add the ability to share pictures with anyone via e-mail (take that Facebook) and Google+ is now <em>the</em> best social network to host and share photos. </p>
<p>Why is this important? It encroaches directly on Facebook&#39;s bread and butter, sharing pictures. Take a look at the <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats/">statistics</a>. As of May 2013 Facebook hosts 240 billion photos and averages roughly 350 million photo uploads per day. This implies (and my limited anecdotal evidence supports) that most Facebook users view the site as a photo sharing service. If Google can gain mindshare as the premiere social network for sharing photos you may see a large defection users from Facebook. </p>
