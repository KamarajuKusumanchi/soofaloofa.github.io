The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge. </p>
<h3 id="be-concise">Be concise</h3>
<p>The first criteria for the applications was describing your business idea in 100 words or less. 100 words is not a lot so you need to make sure every word counts. This ideal holds true for all writing (&quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/952396-not-a-wasted-word-this-has-been-a-main-point">Not a wasted word</a>&quot;). Every word must have purpose and every sentence must lead to your goal -- helping the reader understand exactly what it is you are trying to do. </p>
<h3 id="be-specific">Be specific</h3>
<p>For the technical portion of your application be sure to include concrete and actionable items that can help you achieve your goal. It&#39;s okay here to talk about more specific domain knowledge and use technical terms. You need to show that you have thought deeply about the problem and about how you can best solve it.</p>
<h3 id="be-realistic">Be realistic</h3>
<p>This advice may not apply to all applications and it would vary depending on your idea. In my case I chose a business idea that had a reasonable chance of making forward progress in the next year. At the very least you must provide some evidence that you are at the stage of your business where you are ready to start formalizing your plans and start working towards your goals.</p>
<h3 id="have-someone-proofread-your-work">Have someone proofread your work</h3>
<p>You absolutely <em>need</em> someone outside your immediate circle to proofread your work. Ideally this person would not know anything about your business or even about your problem domain. You must assume that the judges have never heard of your problem and know nothing about your area of expertise. This means you must educate them about what the problem is and how you are going to solve it using plain English. I was lucky enough to have my wife Manon, who has outstanding talent in grant and proposal writing, go over the application with a fine toothed comb. I cannot stress enough how much this helped me convey my idea in an understandable way.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already had our first workshop session and I&#39;ve learned a ton already.

I found a Chef cookbook to install node and after a bit of work have a cookbook that will install arbitrary node packages through npm.  I based this heavily on <a href="https://github.com/balbeko/chef-npm">balbeko</a>&#39;s chef-npm cookbook with modifications to accept a data bag list of npm packages. Any packages in this list will be installed by Chef.</p>
<p>Behold! My first <a href="https://github.com/soofaloofa/chef-npm-package-install">Chef cookbook</a>.</p>

But to me the biggest and most important announcement was the new <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/googles-new-google-photo-features-15gb-full-size-storage-auto-highlight-auto-enhance-more/">Google+ photo features</a>. Full-size high-resolution photos, automatic highlights of entire albums, automatic enhancement and auto-awesome combine to make Google+ <em>the</em> most feature packed photo hosting service on the web. Add the ability to share pictures with anyone via e-mail (take that Facebook) and Google+ is now <em>the</em> best social network to host and share photos. </p>
<p>Why is this important? It encroaches directly on Facebook&#39;s bread and butter, sharing pictures. Take a look at the <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats/">statistics</a>. As of May 2013 Facebook hosts 240 billion photos and averages roughly 350 million photo uploads per day. This implies (and my limited anecdotal evidence supports) that most Facebook users view the site as a photo sharing service. If Google can gain mindshare as the premiere social network for sharing photos you may see a large defection users from Facebook. </p>

The build quality and user experience of the iPod, iPhone and iPad positioned Apple as the most profitable company in the world. However, with the build quality of rival devices quickly approaching Apple quality, software will be the next battleground for consumer loyalty. And Apple has a software problem.</p>
<p>The release of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/04/google-now-on-your-iphone-and-ipad-with.html">Google Now</a> for iOS has shown that Google’s software engineering and user interface design can combine to release high quality, functional products surpassing those custom-built by Apple on Apple’s own hardware. Cloud-based mobile apps will continue to gain users and Google’s cloud based offerings are on a completely different level than Apples meagre offerings. In my personal experience Apple’s Reminders App constantly goes out of sync between my iPad and iPhone — with only a simple to-do list on two devices! As more and more data is pushed to the cloud Google’s offerings will continue to outpace what Apple’s — Google has solved so many distributed and cloud computing problems and their infrastructure is not easily replicated.</p>
<p>I have completely replaced Safari with Google Search and Google Chrome, Mail with Gmail, Siri with Google Voice Search, and Google Now is a complete product offering with no answer from Apple. These services work even better with deeper integration and for my next phone I’ll be switching over to Android to gain this integration. As Google Plus and the Google identity layer gain more penetration, more and more people will be using Google products. Imagine a new user with a Google account and a few Google services buying a phone. You can buy Android, sign in once and all your data is exactly where you expect. Or you can buy Apple, download 3 apps, configure the rest to work properly with your existing calendar and hope that everything stays in sync. I know what I do.</p>

For the longest time I was not sure how to create a new file using NERDTree. I finally sat down and figure out how it works.</p>
<p>First, bring up NERDTree and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new file. Press <code>m</code> to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu. This menu allows you to create, rename, and delete files and directories. Type <code>a</code> to add a child node and then simply enter the filename. You’re done! To create a directory follow the same steps but append a <code>/</code> to the filename.</p>
