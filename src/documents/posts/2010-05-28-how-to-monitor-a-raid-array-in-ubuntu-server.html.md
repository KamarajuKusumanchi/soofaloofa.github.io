title: How to monitor a RAID array in Ubuntu server

I’ve been searching for a way to reliably monitor a RAID array.  I found a few resources and decided to compile them in one post.  If you are running Ubuntu Server skip to the bottom for some good news. 

## /proc/mdstat

The first resource I found is from the [Linux RAID wiki][1].

 [1]: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Detecting,_querying_and_testing#Monitoring_RAID_arrays:/etc/cron.d

The raid role numbers \[#\] following each device indicate its role, or function, within the raid set. Any device with “n” or higher are spare disks. 0,1,..,n-1 are for the working array.

Given this information you could write a script that polls /proc/mdstat searching for character sequence \[UU\] and then schedule this via cron. That seemed like a good solution, but I had also heard about mdadm and wanted to investigate it too.

## mdadm

Also from the [Linux RAID wiki][1].

Also, follow mode can be used to trigger contingency commands if a disk fails, like giving a second chance to a failed disk by removing and reinserting it, so a non-fatal failure could be automatically solved.

## ubuntu server

This was all great but now my dilemma was in deciding how to put this information to use.  I searched some more and came across the following from [ServerFault][2].

So, it turns out that my version of Ubuntu Server was already monitoring data integrity once a month.  I then decided to search my init scripts to see what was installed by default and found /etc/init.d/mdadm.  It turns out that, by default, a daemon job to monitor the array (with the mdadm –monitor command shown above) is run at startup and will send mail to root for any strange occurrence. So, if you are running a debian-based server and wish to monitor the state of your RAID array you really don’t have to do anything at all.  But how about sending root mail to your external e-mail address.  Well, that’s the subject of [another post][3].
