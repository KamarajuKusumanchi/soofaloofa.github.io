      <p>
        <p><em><a href="http://www.startupbook.net">Start Small, Stay Small</a></em> by serial micropreneur Rob Walling is possibly the best book on lean startup marketing you could find. It is a short book — coming in at only 134 pages — yet very word, every sentence and every paragraph <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/">tells</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2011-04-20-constants-in-javascript">Constants in JavaScript</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Wednesday, April 20, 2011.


    </small>

    
      <p>How are constants declared in JavaScript?</p>
<p>You could use the const keyword like so.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs coffeescript"><span class="hljs-reserved">const</span> pi = <span class="hljs-number">3.14</span>;
<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.writeln(<span class="hljs-string">"pi is roughly"</span>   pi   <span class="hljs-string">"."</span>);
</code></pre><p>But watch out!  The MDN’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">JavaScript Reference</a> says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>const</code> is a <strong>Mozilla-specific extension</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constants are actually not part of the JavaScript specification and we’ll have to roll our own solution.  We could use the <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/">module  pattern</a> and create accessor functions to our constant data like this.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs actionscript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> CONSTANTS = (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> = {
    <span class="hljs-string">'PI'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'3.14'</span>,
  };

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(name)</span> {</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span>[name]; }
  };
})();

alert(<span class="hljs-string">'PI: '</span>   CONSTANTS.<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'PI'</span>));
</code></pre><p>This prevents write access to our data and allows read access through a bit of extra syntax.  Another method is to simply use a convention such as ALL CAPS to define constants. Most programmers know this convention and will respect it.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fix"><span class="hljs-attribute">var PI </span>=<span class="hljs-string"> 3.14;
</span></code></pre><p>The solution I use is to place all constants in an object literal.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fix"><span class="hljs-attribute">var CONSTANTS </span>=<span class="hljs-string"> {
  pi : 3.14
};
</span></code></pre><p>This strikes me as a good compromise between the ALL CAPS convention and the over engineered module pattern solution.  What do you think?</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2011-03-23-custom-posterous-subdomains-with-cpanel">Custom Posterous Subdomains with CPanel</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Wednesday, March 23, 2011.


    </small>

    
      <p>I recently started using Posterous and will be converting my WordPress blog to the service.  One thing I wanted was a custom subdomain (i.e., blog.kevinsookocheff.com); I couldn’t easily find clear instructions for  subdomains (just for domains) so I thought I’d share how I did it from a basic cPanel hosting environment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your cPanel account.</li>
<li>Under the Domains heading, select Simple DNS Zone Editor.</li>
<li>Select your domain from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Under Add a CNAME Record fill in the following (using blog here as your subdomain). <ol>
<li>Name: blog</li>
<li>CNAME: posterous.com</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Click the button to Add CNAME Record.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have to wait a few hours for the change to propagate.  Then navigate to yoursubdomain.domain.com.  You will end up at a posterous.com 404 page.  This is because Posterous does not know to link your subdomain to your Posterous yet. Head over to posterous.com and log in.  From here click on your site settings link and enter yoursubdomain.domain.com as the custom domain for you Posterous.</p>

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, March 22, 2011.


    </small>

    
      <p>This morning I noticed that hovering over links in IE 9 causes slight mouse lag on low-powered computers.  The culprit?  A pop-up notification at the bottom left of the window displaying the link target.  The fix?  Permanently display the Status bar by right-clicking an open space to the right of the New tab button, and selecting Status bar.</p>
<p>Most computers would laugh at the prospect of rendering this insignificant detail but this otherwise lovely MSI Wind Nettop 100 couldn’t handle it.  Now it can.</p>

    </small>

    
      <p>I just finished my latest application for Windows Phone 7: Simply Pomodoro.</p>
<p>Simply Pomodoro provides a simple timer to follow the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>™ created by Francesco Cirillo. If you don’t know anything about the Pomodoro Technique here’s a quick overview.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a task.</li>
<li>Work for 25 minutes. No interruptions.</li>
<li>Take a 5 minute break.</li>
<li>Repeat until the task is finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>It really is that simple! I’ve been using this technique for a while now and although it takes discipline I’ve found that I’m able to maintain sustained productivity throughout the day especially during heavy computer use. Taking periodic breaks to stretch my body and rest my eyes is a simple and effective way to avoid burnout.</p>
<p>If you are interested, here is the app description and a link to download it yourself!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply Pomodoro is a time management technique for getting the most out of your work day. Become more focused, more productive, and more energetic while completing your most important goals.

        Closures are easy. There I said it. Invest a little bit of time, and you will say it too. Follow along with me as I attempt to explain what closures are and how they are used.

      <p>
        WordPress’ new TwentyTen theme is terrific. Well supported, highly modifiable, and with tons of widgets to get the exact layout you desire right out of the box. However, one thing I didn’t like too much was having a big header image on the page. I’m a bit of a minimalist so I wanted to trim down the theme by removing the banner image and the navigation bar. Here's how I did it.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2011-01-15-the-future-of-mobile-development">The future of mobile development</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Saturday, January 15, 2011.


    </small>

    
      <p>The future of mobile development is cross-platform HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.  Let me explain. I’ve been working on a couple Windows Phone 7 applications to accompany my first release, <a href="http://www.appsfuze.com/applications/windowsphone.photo/faceart,3617">FaceArt</a>, in the Marketplace. As I do more research and development with the mobile platform I keep looking for ways to increase the reach of my apps. The most obvious is to release Android and iOS versions but I have a few hurdles to clear first, the biggest being lack of time. I do all development as a moonlighting gig while I work full-time and I’m already struggling to find extra hours during the week to finish my first three applications for one platform. How am I going to write and maintain three separate codebases for each app for the major mobile platforms while still keeping my employer happy during the work week?  The solution is cross-platform libraries targeting mobile and web apps. <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>, <a href="http://www.airplaysdk.com">AirPlay</a>, and <a href="http://www.dragonfiresdk.com">DragonFire SDK</a> are a few notable products designed for just this problem.  The most notable, and most intriguing for me, is PhoneGap. I first noticed PhoneGap through an article on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/introducing-the-ars-technica-reader-for-ipad.ars">ArsTechnica</a>. This open-source solution wraps apps designed with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS in a container suitable for the respective app stores. Why is this exciting? You can design an application for the web and get the mobile app for free (or minimal) time investment.  This is as close to the write once, run anywhere ideal that we will get for mobile phones and as the tools improve the experience is only going to get better for developers.  I personally can’t wait to see what the future holds for this product. What do you think?</p>

      <p>
        <p>In order to have a home server you need the server.  That is, you need the hardware.  You could probably find all sorts of information comparing performance, power consumption, and cost for an assortment of different parts (check [tomshardware.com][1] or do some intense [Googling][2]).  Or, you can trust that I’ve done my research and go with the same setup as me.</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2011-01-06-and-the-winner-is-google-chrome">And the winner is - Google Chrome!</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Thursday, January 06, 2011.


    </small>

    
      <p>Google gets it. I recently switched to Google Chrome as my primary web browser and will stick with it for one essential reason.  Speed.  Application launch speed, page loading speed, Javascript speed.  Just plain old speed. When a user opens a browser they are usually expecting to do a few things at the top of their priority list.  Check e-mail, maybe Facebook, check the news headlines and get out. In Firefox there is a significant delay between clicking on the app icon and actually beginning to browse the web.  With Chrome, application launch is almost instantaneous and the difference in user experience is immediately noticeable.  This is a huge win for me and I imagine it will be a huge win for other users who give Chrome a try. Google spends a huge amount of resources in creating efficient algorithms with minimal HTML and Javascript for their flagship products: the search engine, Gmail, and Google Docs.  This attention to efficiency is also paying dividends with Google Chrome and we will continue to see the same gains with Google Chrome OS and Android. Google gets it.</p>
