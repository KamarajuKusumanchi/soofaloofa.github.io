I recently started using the [Pomodore Technique][1] and am absolutely amazed at home much my productivity has increased.   After one full week I can honestly say I am a convert.  My productivity, and my job satisfaction, has increased knowing that I am making progress towards a goal — each and every day.

If you are not aware of the Pomodoro Technique I will explain it briefly here.  For more information, head over to the [website][1].

The Pomodoro Technique can be split into five steps:

1.  Choose a task to be accomplished
2.  Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)
3.  Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper
4.  Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)
5.  Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break

That’s it, that’s all.  It really doesn’t get any harder (or easier).  Avoid interruptions and try to be consistent.  Do this for a week and you will be amazed at how much you can accomplish.
