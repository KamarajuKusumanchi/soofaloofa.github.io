      <p>
        One of the first steps in selling a new product or service is finding your target market and one of the best ways of finding your target market is by defining your ideal customer. Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to. Let's go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.

      <p>
        <p>I recently received the good news that my business idea was accepted for the <a href="http://www.usask.ca/research/ilo/business_plan.php">University of Saskatchewan&#39;s 2014 Tech Venture Challenge</a>. The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge.</p>

      Posted on Thursday, June 06, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>I wanted to set up a Vagrant instance with node.js and some specific packages pre-installed. I found a Chef cookbook to install node and after a bit of work have a cookbook that will install arbitrary node packages through npm.  I based this heavily on <a href="https://github.com/balbeko/chef-npm">balbeko</a>&#39;s chef-npm cookbook with modifications to accept a data bag list of npm packages. Any packages in this list will be installed by Chef.</p>
<p>Behold! My first <a href="https://github.com/soofaloofa/chef-npm-package-install">Chef cookbook</a>.</p>

      Posted on Thursday, May 16, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>Yesterday&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9pmPa_KxsAM">Google I/O keynote</a> unveiled some new features in Music, Maps and Search. But to me the biggest and most important announcement was the new <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/googles-new-google-photo-features-15gb-full-size-storage-auto-highlight-auto-enhance-more/">Google+ photo features</a>. Full-size high-resolution photos, automatic highlights of entire albums, automatic enhancement and auto-awesome combine to make Google+ <em>the</em> most feature packed photo hosting service on the web. Add the ability to share pictures with anyone via e-mail (take that Facebook) and Google+ is now <em>the</em> best social network to host and share photos. </p>
<p>Why is this important? It encroaches directly on Facebook&#39;s bread and butter, sharing pictures. Take a look at the <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats/">statistics</a>. As of May 2013 Facebook hosts 240 billion photos and averages roughly 350 million photo uploads per day. This implies (and my limited anecdotal evidence supports) that most Facebook users view the site as a photo sharing service. If Google can gain mindshare as the premiere social network for sharing photos you may see a large defection users from Facebook. </p>

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, April 30, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>No one can question Apple’s dominance in hardware. The build quality and user experience of the iPod, iPhone and iPad positioned Apple as the most profitable company in the world. However, with the build quality of rival devices quickly approaching Apple quality, software will be the next battleground for consumer loyalty. And Apple has a software problem.</p>
<p>The release of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/04/google-now-on-your-iphone-and-ipad-with.html">Google Now</a> for iOS has shown that Google’s software engineering and user interface design can combine to release high quality, functional products surpassing those custom-built by Apple on Apple’s own hardware. Cloud-based mobile apps will continue to gain users and Google’s cloud based offerings are on a completely different level than Apples meagre offerings. In my personal experience Apple’s Reminders App constantly goes out of sync between my iPad and iPhone — with only a simple to-do list on two devices! As more and more data is pushed to the cloud Google’s offerings will continue to outpace what Apple’s — Google has solved so many distributed and cloud computing problems and their infrastructure is not easily replicated.</p>
<p>I have completely replaced Safari with Google Search and Google Chrome, Mail with Gmail, Siri with Google Voice Search, and Google Now is a complete product offering with no answer from Apple. These services work even better with deeper integration and for my next phone I’ll be switching over to Android to gain this integration. As Google Plus and the Google identity layer gain more penetration, more and more people will be using Google products. Imagine a new user with a Google account and a few Google services buying a phone. You can buy Android, sign in once and all your data is exactly where you expect. Or you can buy Apple, download 3 apps, configure the rest to work properly with your existing calendar and hope that everything stays in sync. I know what I do.</p>

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Friday, April 19, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>I’m not sure why this was so difficult to discover. For the longest time I was not sure how to create a new file using NERDTree. I finally sat down and figure out how it works.</p>
<p>First, bring up NERDTree and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new file. Press <code>m</code> to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu. This menu allows you to create, rename, and delete files and directories. Type <code>a</code> to add a child node and then simply enter the filename. You’re done! To create a directory follow the same steps but append a <code>/</code> to the filename.</p>

      <p>
        Submitting a Unity3d game to the Mac App Store is a somewhat painful process. This guide refers to Unity3d 3.5 but should apply to Unity 4.0 and up.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2013-01-22-copying-from-the-vim-to-the-os-x-mountain-lion-clipboard">Copying from Vim to the OS X Mountain Lion clipboard</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, January 22, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>The latest version of OS X (Mountain Lion) broke compatibility with the vim and the OS clipboard. In most cases you can configure vim to use the operating system clipboard by setting <code>clipboard=unnamed</code> in your <code>.vimrc</code>. Unfortunately this setting does not work in OS X because the default version of vim was not compiled with clipboard support. You can check if your version of vim is compiled with clipboard support by typing <code>vim –version</code>  and looking for <code>clipboard</code>. A prepended <code>+</code> means support is enabled. A prepended <code>–</code> means support is disabled.</p>
<p>So, how do we get clipboard support? By using Macports to install a new version of vim using the <code>huge</code> flag of <code>port install</code>. I also compiled with support for python, ruby, and cscope.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> port install vim huge python ruby cscope
</code></pre>

    </small>

    
      <p>I&#39;ve been working with Prime31&#39;s Etcetera plugin for iOS development with Unity3d. There are a lot of great things in there but some of the documentation is lacking.<br>Anyways, if you want to show a local web page with the <code>showWebPage</code> command it is a two step process.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Copy the files you wish to access into a folder called <code>StreamingAssets</code> under your <code>Assets</code> directory.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Call <code>EtceteraBinding</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs avrasm">EtceteraBinding<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.showWebPage</span>(Application<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.dataPath</span> + <span class="hljs-string">"/Raw/FolderWithHTML/index.html"</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>where <code>FolderWithHTML</code> is the folder you placed in the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder.</p>
