[In the last article](http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/) we examined how to run one-off tasks that operate on a large dataset using a `mapreduce.yaml` configuration file. This article will take us a step further and look at how to run a MapReduce job programmatically using the App Engine Pipeline API.

## Running a Mapper Job Using the App Engine Pipeline API

MapReduce jobs are based on the [App Engine Pipeline API](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-pipeline/) for connecting together time-consuming or complex workflows. We can define a pipeline for our MapReduce job to connect each stage of the MapReduce flow to one another. Let's start by defining a pipeline for our simple `Touch` job that will update the timestamp of every entity Kind we specify.

To create a pipeline we inherit from the `Pipeline` object.

```python
from mapreduce.lib import pipeline

class TouchPipeline(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """
    Pipeline to update the timestamp of entities.
    """
    pass
```

Our pipeline requires a single `run` method. Within this method we set the specification of our `map` function and yield a `Pipeline` object.

```
from mapreduce.lib import pipeline
from mapreduce import mapreduce_pipeline

class TouchPipeline(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """
    Pipeline to update the timestamp of entities.
    """

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """ run """
        mapper_params = {
            "entity_kind": "app.models.user.UserModel",
        }
        yield mapreduce_pipeline.MapperPipeline(
            "Touch all entities",
            handler_spec="app.pipelines.touch",
            input_reader_spec="mapreduce.input_readers.DatastoreInputReader",
            params=mapper_params,
            shards=64)
```

In this piece of code we define a MapperPipeline and pass it the parameters used to initialize the pipeline. The map function is specified by the`handler_spec` parameter and our InputReader is given by the `input_reader_spec` parameter.  You'll notice from our [previous article on running a MapReduce job using mapreduce.yaml](http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/) that the parameters passed here match the specification supplied by the `mapreduce.yaml` file in that article. In effect, we are looking at two different ways to define the same specification for a MapReduce job. The benefit of the pipelined approach here is that we can easily start our job programmatically by instantiating our `Pipeline` object and executing the `start()` method.

```python
pipeline = TouchPipeline()
pipeline.start()
```

Executing this code will start the MapReduce job. You can view the progress at the URL `/mapreduce`, analagous to when starting the MapReduce job through the UI using `mapreduce.yaml`.

## Adding a Reduce Step to Our MapReduce Job

The previous example uses a `MapperPipeline` to define a job that executes a map function on every entity of a certain Kind. What about reduce? For this we turn to the `MapreducePipeline` object. This object accepts parameters for a `mapper_spec` and a `reducer_spec`. We can use this pipeline to perform a full MapReduce job. To make this discussion concrete and generate some useable code let's use a feature built in to the MapReduce library especially for testing, the `RandomStringInputReader`.

The `RandomStringInputReader` generates `x` random strings of `y` length. `x` and `y` are both parameters we can use to control the reader.  We can use this reader to create an example application that counts the number of occurrences of each character found in a random string.

For example, given ten random strings 20 characters in length

```
nzkeasmekjwewmvxgdre
pczrbnzpacpwxpmiffgw
kwsufcunznnzwqmfbszu
gmmfhvikvexnamjorxod
hpaedhjzuziouxaplnmp
thurvybxiuxaskoxjvco
ovwbokvfjiuoawyavpbs
hymsucnolibdivisotrt
durcotpoydwvkvtyyudl
fujkmdenoexximucikfv
```

we want to find the total occurrences of each character.

```
(n, 9)
(z, 8)
(k, 9)
etc.
```

Performing this calculation using MapReduce implies a two step process. First, the map function will count the number of occurrences of each letter in a given string. Second, the reduce function will sum these numbers for all strings to find the final result.

Let's start by setting up a `MapreducePipeline` object using the `RandomStringInputReader` reader as our `input_reader_spec` along with a skeleton `map` and `reduce` function. 

```python
from mapreduce.lib import pipeline
from mapreduce import mapreduce_pipeline

def character_count_map(random_string):
    pass

def character_count_reduce(key, values):
    pass

class CountCharactersPipeline(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """ Count the number of occurrences of a character. """

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """ run """
        mapper_params = {
            "count": 100,
            "string_length": 20,
        }
        yield mapreduce_pipeline.MapreducePipeline(
            "character_count",
            mapper_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_map",
            mapper_params=mapper_params,
            reducer_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_reduce",
            input_reader_spec="mapreduce.input_readers.RandomStringInputReader",
            shards=16)
```

We can use a standard `RequestHandler` to execute our mock MapReduce Pipeline.

```python
import webapp2

class CountCharacters(webapp2.RequestHandler):

    def get(self):
        pipeline = CountCharactersPipeline()
        pipeline.start()
```

Let's flesh out our MapReduce template to actually count the characters in a string. To do so our map function will yield a tuple of `(character, count)` for each character encountered in our string and the number of times it was encountered. So for our input string `nzkeasmekjwewmvxgdre` we would yield `(n, 1)`, `(z, 1)`, `(k, 2)`, and so on. We update our `map` function to do this work.

```python
import collections

def character_count_map(random_string):
    counter = collections.Counter(random_string)
    for character in counter.elements():
        yield (character, counter[character])
```

Each tuple returned by our `map` will be fed to the Shuffle stage of the MapReduce job. The Shuffle stage groups all the values having the same key before passing the result to the `reduce` function. For example, if we yielded `(n, 1)` during one execution of our `map` function and `(n, 4)` in another execution, the Shuffle stage would group these and pass `n, [1, 4]` as the parameters to our `reduce` function (for more information on Shuffle refer to [Part 1 of this guide](http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-04-15-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-1-the-basics/)).

Our reduce function takes the list of values returned by the Shuffle stage and
sums them.

```python
def character_count_reduce(key, values):
    yield (key, sum([int(i) for i in values]))
```

We now have a full MapReduce job that will count the occurrence of each character for a set of random strings. Running our pipeline shows the map, shuffle and reduce stages operating over our dataset.

## Where Is My Data?

How does the output of the `map` function arrive at the `reduce` function? If you look at the application logs you will see periodic writes to the blobstore.

```bash
Shard 1578130350583CAC16BCF-11 finalized blobstore file /blobstore/writable:RDlESEY4Q1U2UkRXT0pCVUpUTFQySlQ5VEJaTkJGUEpQS0RITVgzQ1lVREtKSzVUWTJVRlhTQjYwWFAzSE02OQ==.
Finalized name is /blobstore/7BpFYTPsvNp95XA2uS1MlBm1DsVegjTEO9EP6TAbXZAtsxV5C7HjuZmYnqPuXdJC.
```

These writes provide the blobstore location of the intermediate results from our calculation. A *master* MapReduce task coordinates with the individual `map`, `shuffle` and `reduce` shards to share these results via blobstore keys.

## Writing our Results with OutputWriters

The last thing we need to finish our MapReduce job is outputting the result. To do so we add an `output_writer_spec` to our MapReduce initialization.

```python
class CountCharactersPipeline(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """ Count the number of occurrences of a character. """

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """ run """
        mapper_params = {
            "count": 100,
            "string_length": 20,
        }
        yield mapreduce_pipeline.MapreducePipeline(
            "character_count",
            mapper_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_map",
            mapper_params=mapper_params,
            reducer_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_reduce",
            input_reader_spec="mapreduce.input_readers.RandomStringInputReader",
            output_writer_spec="mapreduce.output_writers.BlobstoreOutputWriter",
            shards=16)
```

Unfortunately we don't know where the `BlobstoreOutputWriter` saves our result. To access this we can capture the output of the `MapreducePipeline`.

```python
class CountCharactersPipeline(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """ Count the number of occurrences of a character. """

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """ run """
        mapper_params = {
            "count": 100,
            "string_length": 20,
        }
        output = yield mapreduce_pipeline.MapreducePipeline(
            "character_count",
            mapper_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_map",
            mapper_params=mapper_params,
            reducer_spec="app.pipelines.character_count_reduce",
            input_reader_spec="mapreduce.input_readers.RandomStringInputReader",
            output_writer_spec="mapreduce.output_writers.BlobstoreOutputWriter",
            shards=16)

        yield StoreOutput(output)
```

`output` is a `PipelineFuture` object -- a generator that takes on a value after the execution of the `MapreducePipeline` is complete. We can access the value of this generator from within a second pipeline object that writes the location of the blobkey to the datastore for future retrievals..

```python
class CharacterCounter(ndb.Model):
    count = ndb.StringProperty(required=True)

class StoreOutput(pipeline.Pipeline):
    """A pipeline to store the result of the MapReduce job in the database. """

    def run(self, output):
        counter = CharacterCounter(count=output[0])
        counter.put()
```

This is a simplified version of the StoreOutput pipeline provided by the [MapReduce Made Easy demo application](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/python/demo/main.py#333).

## Conclusions

In this article we've shown how to perform a full MapReduce job using the Google App Engine MapReduce API for Python. MapReduce is a powerful abstraction to use when processing large datasets. This article should provide a good starting point for defining and running your own MapReduce jobs. For reference here is the full source code used in this post.
