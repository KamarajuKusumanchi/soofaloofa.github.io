      <p>
        <p>The typical update cycle for an API resource is to (1) GET the representation, (2) modify it and (3) PUT back the entire representation. This can waste bandwidth and processing time for large resources. An alternative is to use the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">HTTP PATCH</a> extension method to only send the differences between two resources. HTTP PATCH applies a set of changes to the document referenced by the HTTP request. Let&#39;s examine the JSON Patch format for HTTP PATCH requests.</p>

      Posted on Tuesday, April 01, 2014.

      <p>
        API versioning is a fact of life. Even the most well designed API changes as new features and relationships are uncovered. Unfortunately, updating an API is seldom as simple as changing the behaviour of our existing URL endpoints on her he server. If we have existing clients we need to explicitly advertise breaking changes in a seamless way. This article explains a few methods of specifying breaking changes that offer a clear upgrade path for existing API clients.

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Thursday, March 27, 2014.


    </small>

    
      <p>
        <p>The HTTP protocol defines two methods for updating a resource -- <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code>. Both <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code> are used to modify a resource and this semantic similarity can confuse API developers. This confusion has led most developers to use <code>POST</code> for any action which may modify the state of a resource, ignoring <code>PUT</code> entirely. This article attempts to explain the semantics behind the <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code> methods and offers clear suggestions on when to use each method.</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2014-03-25-stripe-checkout-opening-in-a-new-tab">Stripe checkout opening in a new tab</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, March 25, 2014.


    </small>

    
      <p>At <a href="http://www.vendasta.com">VendAsta</a> we&#39;ve been integrating with the <a href="http://stripe.com/checkout">Stripe</a> payment system using Stripe Checkout. The experience has been completely painless and surprisingly simple. Then came a hiccup. While demoing the new functionality we found that one particular computer in the office would open the checkout modal dialog in a new browser window. Just one laptop. It was running the same version of Chrome that we were developing on. It was running the same OS as a working test machine. But the dialog would consistently open in a new browser window on just this one laptop. </p>
<p>After a Friday afternoon debugging session our Product Owner decided to jump onto IRC and chat directly with the Stripe developers. They were quickly able to diagnose our problem: touch. The troublesome laptop was a Windows 8 machine with a touch display — and Stripe Checkout will open in a new browser window when used on a tablet.</p>
<p>This episode was a great reminder of how the first step in debugging is often to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsAssertYourAssumptionsAndDiffYourSourceCode.aspx">find the difference between the working and non-working system</a>. Hopefully this post will help someone else with the same problem. </p>
<p>P.S. Kudos to Stripe for their prompt help via IRC.</p>

      Posted on Wednesday, March 19, 2014.

      <p>
        REST was developed and formalized by analyzing the existing Web and extracting the principles that made it work. This set of principles was written down in the [Fielding dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) which lays out the set of constraints that, when enforced, will make a generic network system into a resilient network like the Web. This post examines why REST is important for modern APIs.

      <p>
        In recent years REST has been at the forefront of modern API design. This has led to APIs with manageable URLs that respect the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT [and the rest](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html)), producing an intuitive model for client developers. Unfortunately, there are two problems that REST doesn't solve alone.

      <p>Well the New Year is upon us and I decided to take a fresh approach to this website. I&#39;ve migrated to a new domain and re-written the site from the ground up using <a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve migrated the existing comments (and maybe lost a few) but haven&#39;t bothered to redirect any old posts to their new home. I&#39;m definitely starting fresh!</p>

      <p>
        One of the first steps in selling a new product or service is finding your target market and one of the best ways of finding your target market is by defining your ideal customer. Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to. Let's go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.

      <p>
        <p>I recently received the good news that my business idea was accepted for the <a href="http://www.usask.ca/research/ilo/business_plan.php">University of Saskatchewan&#39;s 2014 Tech Venture Challenge</a>. The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge.</p>
