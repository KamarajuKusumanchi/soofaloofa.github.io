The experience has been completely painless and surprisingly simple. Then came a hiccup. While demoing the new functionality we found that one particular computer in the office would open the checkout modal dialog in a new browser window. Just one laptop. It was running the same version of Chrome that we were developing on. It was running the same OS as a working test machine. But the dialog would consistently open in a new browser window on just this one laptop. </p>
<p>After a Friday afternoon debugging session our Product Owner decided to jump onto IRC and chat directly with the Stripe developers. They were quickly able to diagnose our problem: touch. The troublesome laptop was a Windows 8 machine with a touch display — and Stripe Checkout will open in a new browser window when used on a tablet.</p>
<p>This episode was a great reminder of how the first step in debugging is often to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsAssertYourAssumptionsAndDiffYourSourceCode.aspx">find the difference between the working and non-working system</a>. Hopefully this post will help someone else with the same problem. </p>
<p>P.S. Kudos to Stripe for their prompt help via IRC.</p>

the principles that made it work. This set of principles was written down in the
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Fielding dissertation</a>
which lays out the set of constraints that, when enforced, will make a generic
network system into a resilient network like the Web. In Chapter 5 of the
dissertation Fielding outlines REST&#39;s interface constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources;
manipulation of resources using representations; self-descriptive messages;
and, hypermedia as the engine of application state. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="why-is-this-important-for-apis-">Why is this important for APIs?</h4>
<p>API design is in an infancy. Each API is designed for a single use case and
standard. This proliferation of different design ideas results in APIs that each
have their own specification and semantics. Interoperability between APIs is
nonexistent. In the early 1990s the Web was facing this exact problem and as a
result the principles of REST were formalized and adopted. The result was a
scalable, resilient and ultimately successful system. By adopting the REST
constraints in our APIs we can take advantage of this foundational work to
provide APIs that form a scalable and resilient network of their own.</p>
<p>We will take a look at each of the four interface constraints in turn and see
how they can be used to design an API that developers love to use. </p>
<h3 id="1-identification-of-resources">1. Identification of Resources</h3>
<p>A resource is the key abstraction of REST. Anything that can be named is a
resource -- a video, a document, an image. We identify resources using a
unique identifier called the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). When discussing
the Web we almost always use a more specific form of URI called a Uniform
Resource Locator (URL). A URL is what we are all accustomed to when accessing
sites through HTTP.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs avrasm"><span class="hljs-label">http:</span>//sookocheff<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>
</code></pre><p>By building REST APIs over HTTP we can use URLs to identify resources accessed
by our API. To satisfy the REST constraint each URL should map to a single
resource and all access to this resource is done through that URL. As an
example, if I want to offer an API for a shipping application I might have a
resource representing an order. A URL for the individual order numbered <code>12345</code>
would have a path including the order number.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs undefined">/orders/12345
</code></pre><p>This simple example shows how we can create a URL to uniquely represent each
resource represented by our API.</p>
<h3 id="2-manipulation-of-resources-using-representations">2. Manipulation of Resources Using Representations</h3>
<p>When making a request for a resource the server responds with a representation
of the resource. This representation captures the current state of the resource
in a format that the client can understand and manipulate. Abstractly the
representation is a sequence of bytes along with metadata describing those
bytes. This metadata is known as the media type of the representation. Typical
API examples are HTML, JSON, and XML. Because the server sends a representation
of the resource it is possible for the client to request a specific
representation that fits the client&#39;s needs. For example, a client can ask for
the JSON representation of a resource or the XML representation of the resource.
The server may provide this representation if it is capable of doing so. This
concept is called <em>content negotiation</em>. You can use content negotiation in your
API to allow multiple clients to access a different representations of the
resource from the same URL. </p>
<p>The way that a client asks for a specific representation is through the HTTP
<code>Accepts</code> header. The following request is asking for a plain text
representation of the order.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span> /orders/<span class="hljs-number">12345</span>
Accept: <span class="hljs-keyword">text</span>/plain
</code></pre><p>Whereas the following request is asking for a JSON representation.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">GET</span> /orders/<span class="hljs-number">12345</span>
Accept: application/json
</code></pre><p>By using content negotiation in your API you can offer new resource
representations without changing the resources URL or breaking existing clients.
This keeps your client and server flexibly decoupled.</p>
<h3 id="3-self-descriptive-messages">3. Self-Descriptive Messages</h3>
<p>The representations served by a RESTful system contain all of the data required
by the client to understand and act on the resource. If any additional
information is needed but not contained in the response a link to that
information should be provided within the response. This means that the media
type you choose to respond with should be self documenting and should list any
related resources or actions that the client may be interested in. Specific
media types already exist for JSON APIS. These include HAL, JSON-LD,
Collection+JSON and JSONAPI. For a detailed discussion see my post <a href="http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-03-11-on-choosing-a-hypermedia-format/">on
choosing a hypermedia
type</a></p>
<p>Each of these formats are aiming to solve the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#basic-concepts">same
problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON has no built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building
block on the Web. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By linking together the resources offered by your API you can build
self-descriptive APIs.</p>
<h3 id="4-hypermedia-as-the-engine-of-application-state">4. Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State</h3>
<p>Together, the first three REST constraints imply the fourth and most important --
hypermedia as the engine of application state. By uniquely identifying
resources, using representations to communicate resource state and using
self-descriptive messages via media types all application state stays with the
client. </p>
<p>By keeping all application state with the client a direct connection between the
client and the server is not necessary, allowing the server to scale to serve
many clients with minimal resources. This ability to scale has led to the Web&#39;s
scalable and resilient nature. </p>
<p>By designing our APIs with the REST constraints we can build scalable and
resilient APIs.</p>

Updated on <time datetime="2014-2-13">Thursday, March 13, 2014</time>.</small><div class="post-content"><p>In recent years REST has been at the forefront of modern API 
design. This has led to APIs with manageable URLs that respect the HTTP verbs
(GET, POST, PUT <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">and the
 rest</a>), producing an
intuitive model for client developers. Unfortunately, there are two problems
that REST doesn&#39;t solve alone.</p>
<p>The first problem is standardized responses. Most every enterprise has defined
their own custom API format, usually a JSON response that maps neatly to their
own data model. A Facebook API client cannot communicate with a Twitter API and
vice versa. This leads to a proliferation of API clients that do almost -- but
not quite -- the same thing. Duplication of effort abounds.</p>
<p>The second problem is linking. As the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#basic-concepts">W3C puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON has no built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building
block on the Web. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drawback of this is that two API endpoints are only linked together by API
documentation. As a user you are forced to scour through walls of API
documentation to understand the relationships between API endpoints and grasp
exactly what actions you can and cannot take against a given resource.</p>
<p>To solve these problems we can look at how we structure our API responses. By
using <em>hypermedia</em> in our responses we can offer links between API endpoints and
documentation, potential actions, and related endpoints. This allows for
<em>discoverable</em> APIs where it is clear from the API response the set of next
actions that a client may want to take. Furthermore, by <em>standardizing</em> on a
hypermedia type clients developed for one API can understand the format of
another API and communicate with minimal duplicated effort.</p>
<p>In this post I will evaluate a few mature hypermedia types for APIs,
offering a side-by-side comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. If you
are impatient for the final result you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/soofaloofa/9350847">jump straight to the code</a>. </p>
<h3 id="the-model">The Model</h3>
<p>To drive this discussion let&#39;s use a hypothetical API for managing a <code>Player</code>
resource derived from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GameKit/Reference/GKPlayer_Ref/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/GKPlayer"><code>GKPlayer</code>
class</a>
used by Apple&#39;s GameCenter API. The <code>Player</code> resource can be expressed with this
simple diagram.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2014-02-06-on-choosing-a-hypermedia-format/player-model.png" alt="PlayerResource" title="Player Resource"></p>
<p>Representing this as a typical JSON response would yield something like the
following.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">playerId</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1234567890"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">alias</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"soofaloofa"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">displayName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Kevin Sookocheff"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">profilePhotoUrl</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/1234567890/avatar.png"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>And the list of this player&#39;s friends could be retrieved with a separate API call.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>/friends
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">[
{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">playerId</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1895638109"</span></span>,

    "<span class="hljs-attribute">displayName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Sheldon Dong"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">profilePhotoUrl</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/1895638109/avatar.png"</span>
</span>},

    "<span class="hljs-attribute">playerId</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"8371023509"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">alias</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"mliu"</span></span>,

    "<span class="hljs-attribute">profilePhotoUrl</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/8371023509/avatar.png"</span>
</span>}
]
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at how this API can be represented using hypermedia types.</p>
<h3 id="json-ld">JSON-LD</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll start by looking at JSON for Linked Documents (JSON-LD). JSON-LD is a well
supported media type endorsed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web
Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>The selling point of JSON-LD is that you can adopt the standard without
introducing breaking changes to your API. The syntax is designed to not disturb
already deployed systems and to provide a smooth migration path from JSON to
JSON with added semantics. </p>
<p>JSON-LD introduces keywords that augment an existing response with additional
information. The most important augmentation is the <em>context</em>. A context in
JSON-LD defines a set of terms that are scoped and valid within the
representation being discussed. A context is assigned to a JSON response using
the <code>@context</code> keyword.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">@context</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{}
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>Within the context properties are assigned to a URL that provides documentation
about the meaning of that property.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">@context</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">displayName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://schema.org/name"</span>
    </span>}</span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">displayName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Kevin Sookocheff"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s a good idea to use standard naming for our APIs so we can go ahead and
rename <code>displayName</code> to <code>name</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">@context</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://schema.org/name"</span>
    </span>}</span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Kevin Sookocheff"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we have an unambiguous definition of what the property <code>name</code>
means within the API response by visiting <code>https://schema.org/name</code> to read the
semantics of this property. We can go further and add context to the rest of the
properties. To be consistent with existent naming we will change
<code>profilePhotoUrl</code> to <code>image</code> and <code>alias</code> to <code>alternateName</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">@context</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://schema.org/name"</span></span>,
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">alternateName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://schema.org/alternateName"</span></span>,
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">image</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
            "<span class="hljs-attribute">@id</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://schema.org/image"</span></span>,
            "<span class="hljs-attribute">@type</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"@id"</span>
        </span>}
    </span>}</span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">@id</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/1234567890"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">playerId</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1234567890"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Kevin Sookocheff"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">alternateName</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"soofaloofa"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">image</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/1234567890/avatar.png"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example we&#39;ve added the <code>@id</code> annotation. <code>@id</code> signifies <em>identifiers</em>.
Identifiers allow unique external references to any resource, providing similar
semantcis to URLs. In JSON-LD terminology every distinct resource is a node in
the JSON-LD graph. These distinct nodes should have identifiers that can be used
to retrieve a representation of that node. </p>
<p>The last element from our model that is missing from our JSON-LD response is the
list of friends. With JSON-LD unordered lists can be specified using simple
array notation.  In this example we will represent friends by the identifiers
that point to their resources. An HTTP GET request to those URLs would return
the full representation of each friend.</p>

<p>This gives us the representation of our <code>Player</code> resource in JSON-LD. This

format can be used. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markuslanthaler">Markus Lanthaler</a> for offering
suggestions on how to simplify this even more. In this example we define a
<code>@vocab</code> for our context that encompasses the terms that we use within our

<p>The <code>operation</code> property defines a <code>method</code> term that specifies the HTTP method
that the endpoint allows. HYDRA also provides a template of the expected
properties and their data types. In our example a POST request to
<code>https://api.example.com/player/1234567890/friends</code> (the resource&#39;s URL) will
add a new friend to our user&#39;s friend list.</p>
<p>HYDRA also provides a <code>member</code> property that allows us to embed additional
resources within our current representations. In the following example we embed
our friends directly within the resource as a list. </p>

<h3 id="hal">HAL</h3>
<p>HAL is a lightweight media type that uses the idea of <em>Resources</em> and <em>Links</em> to
model your JSON responses. <em>Resources</em> can contain <em>State</em> defined by key-value
pairs of data, <em>Links</em> leading to additional resources and <em>Embedded Resources</em>
which are children of the current resource embedded in the representation for
convenience.</p>
<p>HAL is simple to use and easy to understand. These virtues have lead HAL to
become one of the leading hypermedia types in modern APIs.</p>
<h4 id="state">State</h4>
<p>State is the traditional JSON key-value pairs defining the current state of the
resource.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>

</span>}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>Links in HAL are identified as a JSON object named <code>_links</code>. Keys within
<code>_links</code> are the name of the link and should describe the relationship between
the current resource and the link. At a minimum the <code>_links</code> property should
contain a <code>self</code> entry pointing to the current resource.</p>

<h4 id="embedded-resources">Embedded Resources</h4>
<p>Making a GET request to the <code>Friends</code> link would return a full list of
<code>Player</code> resources. Each <code>Player</code> returned is embedded in the representation
as an <em>Embedded Resource</em>. <em>Embedded Resources</em> augment the current resource
state with additional, related resources. These resources are provided as a
convenience to the client application and can be easily used to represent a
list of items.</p>

<p>An important point about HAL is that each link relation points to a URL with
documentation about that relation. This makes the API discoverable by always
providing documentation about the links available from the current resource. In

<p>Since URLs are long and unwieldy, HAL provides <code>curies</code>. <code>Curies</code> are a reserved
link relation acting as a base URL that is expanded upon by each term. In this
example we will define a <code>curie</code> <code>ex</code> that references the <code>URI</code> 
<code>https://api.example.com/docs/rels/{rel}</code>. <code>Curies</code> are expanded by postfixing
the curie name with a <code>:</code> followed by the name of the resource.</p>

<p>The Collection+JSON standard is a media type that standardizes the reading,
writing and querying of items in a collection. Although geared to handling
collections, by representing a single item as a collection of one element,
Collection+JSON can elegantly handle most API responses.</p>
<p>At a minimum a Collection+JSON response must contain a <code>collection</code> object with
a <code>version</code> and a URI pointing to itself.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">collection</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">version</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1.0"</span></span>,
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">href</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"https://api.example.com/player/1234567890"</span>
    </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="returning-data">Returning Data</h4>
<p>Typically, the response would include a list of items in the collection. For a
single resource, this collection would be a list of a single element. The
properties of each element are given by explicit name/value pairs within a
<code>data</code> attribute as in the following example.</p>

<h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>Links can be a property of the collection or of individual items in the
collection. Links may may also include a <code>name</code> and a <code>prompt</code> which can be
useful when creating HTML forms to reference the collection or item.</p>
<p>In this example we will add links for the <code>Players</code> avatar and friends.</p>

<h4 id="templates">Templates</h4>
<p>As the name would imply, Collection+JSON is uniquely suited to handling
collections. Templates are one aspect of this. A template is an object that
represents an item in the collection. The client can then fill in this template
and POST it to the collection to add an element, or PUT it to update an existing
item.</p>
<p>In this example we define a template for adding to the user&#39;s list of friends.</p>

<p>By defining the template and queries within the response Collection+JSON makes
navigation by a new API user relatively simple without needing to understand the
full meaning of the API. It also provides a level of interoperability between
APIs using the Collection+JSON media type. Collection+JSON was designed by <a href="https://amundsen.com">Mike
Amundsen</a>. You can find detailed examples, the full spec
and sample code <a href="https://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">on his website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="siren">SIREN</h3>
<p>The last media type we&#39;ll look at is
<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">SIREN</a>. SIREN aims to represent generic
entities along with actions for modifying those entities and links for client
navigation.</p>
<h4 id="entities">Entities</h4>
<p>Each SIREN entity may have an optional class that describes the nature of the
entity. This class defines the type of resource being returned by the API.
Think of this as a data model for your API. By defining our response as
returning a <code>player</code> class the API user can immediately gain insight about the
data being returned.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"player"</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<p>The state of the entity is reflected as key-value pairs in a <code>properties</code> object.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs json">{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"player"</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">properties</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">playerId</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"1234567890"</span></span>,
        "<span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Kevin Sookocheff"</span></span>,

    </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre><h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>Links are used in the same sense we&#39;ve already seen in other media types --
navigating to related resources. With SIREN links have a relation and a URL.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">GET https://api.example.com/player/<span class="hljs-number">1234567890</span>

    </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>One of the biggest pieces missing from common Hypermedia types is the ability to
dictate what requests can be made to alter the application state. SIREN
facilitates this by defining <code>actions</code> that a client can take on the given
resource.</p>
<p>SIREN actions show the available HTTP request method and includes the URL for
the request along with fields or variables that the URL accepts. As an example,
our resource for listing a players friends can offer an action to add a
friend to the list, or search for a friend.</p>

<h4 id="entities">Entities</h4>
<p>The previous example also introduces <code>entities</code> to the response.  Any related
entities that you wish to embed in the current representation are entered as a
list of <code>entities</code>. Entities are nested. Each entity in this list can have a
class, properties and additional entities.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve create a <a href="https://gist.github.com/soofaloofa/9350847">Gist</a> comparing each
of the media types discussed in this post. </p>
<p>After going through this exercise I&#39;ve come to a few conclusions. </p>
<h4 id="json-ld">JSON-LD</h4>
<p>JSON-LD is great for augmenting existing APIs without introducing
breaking changes. This augmentation mostly serves as a way to self document your
API. If you are looking to add operations to a JSON-LD response look to HYDRA.
HYDRA adds a vocabulary for communicating using the JSON-LD specification. This
is an interesting choice as it decouples the API serialization format from the
communication format.</p>
<h4 id="hal">HAL</h4>
<p>The light weight syntax and semantics of HAL is appealing in a lot of contexts.
HAL is a minimal representation that offers most of the benefits of using a
hypermedia type without adding too much complexity to the implementation. One
area where HAL falters is, like JSON-LD, the lack of support for specifying
actions.</p>
<h4 id="collection-json">Collection+JSON</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by the name. Collection+JSON can be used to represent single
items as well and it does this quite well. Of course it shines when representing
data collections. Particularly appealing is the ability to list queries that
your collection supports and templates that clients can use to alter your
collection. For publishing user editable data Collection+JSON shines.</p>
<h4 id="siren">SIREN</h4>
<p>SIREN attempts to represent generic classes of items and overcome the main
drawback of HAL -- support for actions. It does this admirably well and also
introduces the concept of classes to your model bringing a sense of type
information to your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="and-the-winner-is-">And the winner is?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no clear winner. It depends on the contraints in place
on your API. However, I will offer some suggestions.</p>
<p>If you are augmenting existing API responses choose JSON-LD.
If you are keeping it simple choose HAL.
If you are looking for a full featured media type choose Collection+JSON.</p>
<p>Did I cover all the bases? Completely miss the mark? Let me know in the
comments!</p>

Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-are-you-selling-">1. What are you selling?</h3>
<p>You need to clearly define what you are selling. This should get very specific and include any different versions or service levels of your product? Are you selling support? Are yo selling security? Think of the pain points of your customer and how what you are selling can alleviate this pain.</p>
<h3 id="2-who-are-you-selling-to-">2. Who are you  selling to?</h3>
<p>Are you selling to consumers or enterprise? Be specific. Is your offering for teachers or principals? Administrators? Try to define the most specific audience you can and then focus your marketing and sales efforts on exactly this audience.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-price-point-">3. What is the price point?</h3>
<p>The ideal answer to this question should come from your ideal customer. Find and reach out to the person or people you have identified in your first two questions and ask them -- What would you pay for a service like this? If you are marketing online try and include a survey and gather as much data as you can about possible price points.</p>
<h3 id="remember-your-goal">Remember your goal</h3>
<p>Throughout this exercise always remember to focus on your goal. The biggest marketing questions you need to ask are &quot;Who would buy this?&quot; followed by &quot;How do I find them?&quot;. If you can answer these two questions with marketing your sales channel and product will help close the deal.</p>
