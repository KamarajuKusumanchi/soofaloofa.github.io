&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/prediction/&#34;&gt;Google Prediction API&lt;/a&gt; offers the
power of Google&amp;rsquo;s machine learning algorithms over a RESTful API interface. The
machine learning algorithms themselves are a complete black box. As a user you
upload the training data and, once it has been analyzed, start classifying new
observations based on the analysis of the training data. I recently spent some
time investigating how to use the API to determine the sentiment of a tweet.
This article collects my thoughts on the experience and a few recommendations
for future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;The Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our experiment we took the text and rating of one million online reviews and
normalized them within a scale of zero to 1000 &amp;ndash; ratings on a scale of one to
four and ratings on a scale of one to ten would be roughly equivalent. We then
segmented the reviews into five broad categories: very negative (0-200),
negative (200-400), neutral (400-600), positive (600-800), very
positive (800-1000). The prediction API requires the data to be in a
specific format; following their guidelines, we stripped the review
text of all punctuation except the apostrophe and lower
cased all characters. What was left was a one million row table with
two columns: the review category and the review content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;very negative, &amp;quot;the waiter was so mean&amp;quot;
positive, &amp;quot;the bisque is the best in town&amp;quot;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data was roughly 1 GB. We uploaded this file to Google Cloud Storage
and used the Prediction API to train our model given this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had a trained model it was time to make predictions. For our application
we took tweets from Twitter mentioning a business and asked the Prediction API
to classify the text of the tweet for sentiment between very negative to very
positive using the normalized review categories of our model. The results were
decidedly mixed as the following examples show. In the first example we attempt
to classify the text &amp;ldquo;this restaurant has the best soup in town&amp;rdquo; and correctly
receive a &amp;ldquo;very positive&amp;rdquo; result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; href=&#34;/img/2014-10-20-prediction-api/bestsoup.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2014-10-20-prediction-api/bestsoup.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Best Soup in Town&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a counter example, the text &amp;ldquo;this restaurant has the worst soup in town&amp;rdquo; also
recieves a &amp;ldquo;very positive&amp;rdquo; result, although with less confidence and with &amp;ldquo;very
negative&amp;rdquo; being the most likely second choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; href=&#34;/img/2014-10-20-prediction-api/worstsoup.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2014-10-20-prediction-api/worstsoup.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Worst Soup in Town&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tweets were categorized as very positive, regardless of content. In
addition, most of the tweets had almost equal likelihood of being in the very
negative or very positive category with very positive being more likely most of
the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Internet reviews are either very positive or very negative so most of the
content from the tweet will fall into one of these categories in our model. I
believe that by adjusting our training data to have equal amounts of reviews for
each category we would get better results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is that if you intend to use the Prediction API for a serious
business task that you also have a strong enough background in machine learning
to tweak your model &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; using the Prediction API to analyze and host it. In
short, use the Prediction API as cloud-based access to your existing model that
you already know works. Don&amp;rsquo;t use the Prediction API to help you build a working
model. The black box nature of the Prediction API makes it difficult to diagnose
and correct any data problems you may have.&lt;/p&gt;
