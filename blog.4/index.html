      <p>Google gets it. I recently switched to Google Chrome as my primary web browser and will stick with it for one essential reason.  Speed.  Application launch speed, page loading speed, Javascript speed.  Just plain old speed. When a user opens a browser they are usually expecting to do a few things at the top of their priority list.  Check e-mail, maybe Facebook, check the news headlines and get out. In Firefox there is a significant delay between clicking on the app icon and actually beginning to browse the web.  With Chrome, application launch is almost instantaneous and the difference in user experience is immediately noticeable.  This is a huge win for me and I imagine it will be a huge win for other users who give Chrome a try. Google spends a huge amount of resources in creating efficient algorithms with minimal HTML and Javascript for their flagship products: the search engine, Gmail, and Google Docs.  This attention to efficiency is also paying dividends with Google Chrome and we will continue to see the same gains with Google Chrome OS and Android. Google gets it.</p>

        To use Ubuntu as an audio production server you need the real-time kernel. This allows applications to have some guarantee of the maximum response time of any task. High priority tasks are given the CPU within a fixed minimum amount of time allowing for processor intensive tasks to actually be completed. Follow along to see how to install the real-time kernel yourself. A vanilla install of most Linux distributions does not enable the real-time kernel, but it is easy enough to install.

        I bought a used Delta 44 soundcard with the intention of recording my guitar playing. Pairing this with Rockit 5 powered monitors, a Mackie 802-VLZ3 mixer and the classic Shure SM57 microphone made for a good quality, inexpensive home studio. Using the PCI-based Delta 44 meant that any old computer would work and my idea was to use vanilla Ubuntu and install the Ardour digital audio workstation to push costs even further down. So far so good. Now the only issue is getting everything up and running. Ubuntu is a fairly mature distribution; you can expect a certain level of quality with each release. Unfortunately, this has not been the case with PulseAudio. I won’t go into details; suffice it to say it had a tumultuous upbringing and many of the kinks have since been worked out. Anyways, I quickly discovered that PulseAudio does not recognize the Delta 44. Don’t worry, this is a known problem and a workaround exists. Finding the workaround, however, did take some time.

        According to Wikipedia, readability is defined as reading ease, especially as it results from a writing style.  Only experience, practice, and hard work can improve a person’s writing style.  Let’s increase readability in a different manner: with typography.

      <p>
        I recently moved all of our household music to a shared network drive and was looking for a solution to stream these libraries as distinct entities; I wanted to keep my wife’s library separate mostly so I could keep all of my painstakingly catalouged music organized exactly how I like it. I was already using mt-daapd, now known as the Firefly Media Server, to stream my own library from my Linux server. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support streaming two libraries from one program instance. The solution to this is to run two copies of mt-daapd and configure them to play nice with each other. Don’t worry, it’s not quite as difficult as it sounds. The first thing you’ll need is to have a separate configuration file for the second daap instance. The easiest way to do this is to copy the files from an existing installation.

      <p>I recently started using Xubuntu to see if the proclaimed speed differences actually made a difference in productivity. Unfortunately, the Thunar file manager does not automatically recognize network drives so I needed to manually mount SAMBA shares from the command line.  In my searches I stumbled across this <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=288534">thread</a> giving the exact solution I used.  Hopefully this helps someone else who is having this same problem.</p>

        <p>I recently started using the [Pomodore Technique][1] and am absolutely amazed at home much my productivity has increased. After one full week I can honestly say I am a convert. My productivity, and my job satisfaction, has increased knowing that I am making progress towards a goal — each and every day.</p>

      <p>
        I recently set up a RAID array wanted to keep notified of any errors that may occur. By default Ubuntu Server sends mail to the root user whenever an error occurs but logging in as root to check mail every so often didn’t seem very convenient. There had to be a better way. The best information that I found came from the Ubuntu community forums. Here I’ll expand on that discussion, hopefully helping other people who are trying to do the same thing. The traditional way to forward mail is to create a .forward file in your home directory, entering the addresses that you would like to forward mail to.

        I’ve been searching for a way to reliably monitor a RAID array.  I found a few resources and decided to compile them in one post.  If you are running Ubuntu Server skip to the bottom for some good news.
