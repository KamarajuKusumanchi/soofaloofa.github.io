      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vendasta.com&#34;&gt;VendAsta&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ve been integrating with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://stripe.com/checkout&#34;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; payment system using Stripe Checkout. The experience has been completely painless and surprisingly simple. Then came a hiccup. While demoing the new functionality we found that one particular computer in the office would open the checkout modal dialog in a new browser window. Just one laptop. It was running the same version of Chrome that we were developing on. It was running the same OS as a working test machine. But the dialog would consistently open in a new browser window on just this one laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a Friday afternoon debugging session our Product Owner decided to jump onto IRC and chat directly with the Stripe developers. They were quickly able to diagnose our problem: touch. The troublesome laptop was a Windows 8 machine with a touch display â€” and Stripe Checkout will open in a new browser window when used on a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode was a great reminder of how the first step in debugging is often to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsAssertYourAssumptionsAndDiffYourSourceCode.aspx&#34;&gt;find the difference between the working and non-working system&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this post will help someone else with the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Kudos to Stripe for their prompt help via IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
