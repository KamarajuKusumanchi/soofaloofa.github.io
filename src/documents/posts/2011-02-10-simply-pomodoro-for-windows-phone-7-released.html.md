I just finished my latest application for Windows Phone 7: Simply Pomodoro.

Simply Pomodoro provides a simple timer to follow the [Pomodoro Technique][1]™ created by Francesco Cirillo. If you don’t know anything about the Pomodoro Technique here’s a quick overview.

1.  Pick a task.
2.  Work for 25 minutes. No interruptions.
3.  Take a 5 minute break.
4.  Repeat until the task is finished.

It really is that simple! I’ve been using this technique for a while now and although it takes discipline I’ve found that I’m able to maintain sustained productivity throughout the day especially during heavy computer use. Taking periodic breaks to stretch my body and rest my eyes is a simple and effective way to avoid burnout.

If you are interested, here is the app description and a link to download it yourself!

> Simply Pomodoro is a time management technique for getting the most out of your work day. Become more focused, more productive, and more energetic while completing your most important goals. You’ll surprise yourself with how easy it is to become more productive! Based on the Pomodoro Technique™ official website – [www.pomodorotechnique.com][2].
