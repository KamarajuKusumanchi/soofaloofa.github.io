                When doing a MapReduce operation there are times when you want to edit a set of entities without triggering the post or pre put hooks associated with those entities. On such ocassions using the raw datastore entity allows you to process the data without unwanted side effects. This article will show how to use the RawDatastoreInputReader to process datastore entities.

                The Cloud Endpoints API comes packaged with endpointscfg.py to generate client libraries in JavaScript, Objective-C (for iOS) and Java (for Android). You can also generate a few additional client libraries using the Google APIs client generator. This article will show you how to use the generator to create a C# client library.

                Cloud Endpoints provides strong integration with OAuth 2.0. If you can use this integration -- do it. However, some legacy systems require supporting alternative authentication mechanisms. This article will show you how to secure an API endpoint using Basic Authentication. You can use this as a starting point for whatever authentication method you choose.

                <p>The recently released <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/modules/">App Engine Modules API</a> allows developers to compartmentalize their applications into logical units that can share state using the datastore or memcache.</p>

<p>The documentation for this API is fairly complete but one part is lacking — running multiple modules locally using dev_appserver.py. Thankfully, the solution is not too complicated.  Just pass the list of <code>.yaml</code> files defining your modules to dev_appserver and it will run all of your modules locally.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">dev_appserver.py src/app.yaml src/backend.yaml src/dispatch.yaml

                At VendAsta we frequently share libraries of code between projects. To make it easier to share this code I&#39;ve developed a small package manager that downloads code within a directory from Github to be copied in to your current project. It&#39;s a quick and dirty alternative to cloning an entire repository, grabbing the set of files you want and placing them in your project.

              Posted on Wednesday, May 28, 2014 · <a href="http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-05-28-how-to-bypass-the-auto-now-property-option-during-an-ndb-put/#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a>

              <p>
                <p>In App Engine the <code>auto_now</code> option sets a property to the current date/time
whenever the entity is created or updated. This is a great feature for tracking
the time when an entity was last updated. However, sometimes you may want to put
an entity without updating an <code>auto_now</code> timestamp. This article will show you
how.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with a very basic ndb model with an <code>updated</code> property having
the <code>auto_now</code> option set to <code>True</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="python">from google.appengine.ext import ndb

class Article(ndb.model):
    title = ndb.model.StringProperty()
    updated = ndb.model.DateTimeProperty(auto_now=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s put the entity to the datastore <em>without updating the timestamp</em> and
<em>completely bypassing the <code>auto_now</code> option</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="python">article = Article(title='Python versus Ruby')
article._properties['updated']._auto_now = False
article.put()
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple, but with caveats. Putting the entity using the code above
will store the updated entity in the instance cache (and memcache). If we get
the entity it will be retrieved from the instance cache with the <code>auto_now</code>
property still set to <code>False</code>. This can have unwanted side-effects because
subsequent updates to the entity will not trigger the <code>auto_now</code> functionality.</p>

<pre><code class="python">article = Article(title='Python versus Ruby')
article._properties['updated']._auto_now = False
key = article.put() # Put the entity with the auto_now option set to False

article = key.get() # Get the entity from instance cache
article.title = 'Python versus Go'
article.put() # Put the entity with the auto_now option *still* set to False
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the <code>auto_now</code> option to <code>True</code> again to re-enable the functionality.</p>

<pre><code class="python">article = Article(title='Python versus Ruby')
article._properties['updated']._auto_now = False
key = article.put()

article._properties['updated']._auto_now = True
article = key.get() # Get the entity from instance cache
article.title = 'Python versus Go'
article.put() # Puts the entity with the auto_now option set to True
</code></pre>

<p>For more information on ndb caching <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/cache">refer to the
documentation</a>.</p>

clang: note: this will be a hard error (cannot be downgraded to a warning) in the future

error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1

<p>The <code>clang</code> compiler distributed with version 5.1 of Xcode tightened up some
restrictions and turned compiler warnings into hard errors. To disable this you need to
add a specific flag to ingore these warnings when installing affected packages.</p>

                This article provides an overview of the App Engine MapReduce API. We will give a basic overview of what MapReduce is and how it is used to do parallel and distributed processing of large datasets.

                The typical update cycle for an API resource is to (1) GET the representation, (2) modify it and (3) PUT back the entire representation. This can waste bandwidth and processing time for large resources. An alternative is to use the HTTP PATCH extension method to only send the differences between two resources. HTTP PATCH applies a set of changes to the document referenced by the HTTP request. Let&#39;s examine the JSON Patch format for HTTP PATCH requests.

                API versioning is a fact of life. Even the most well designed API changes as new features and relationships are uncovered. Unfortunately, updating an API is seldom as simple as changing the behaviour of our existing URL endpoints on her he server. If we have existing clients we need to explicitly advertise breaking changes in a seamless way. This article explains a few methods of specifying breaking changes that offer a clear upgrade path for existing API clients.

                The HTTP protocol defines two methods for updating a resource -- PUT and POST. Both PUT and POST are used to modify a resource and this semantic similarity can confuse API developers. This confusion has led most developers to use POST for any action which may modify the state of a resource, ignoring PUT entirely. This article attempts to explain the semantics behind the PUT and POST methods and offers clear suggestions on when to use each method.

                <p>At <a href="http://www.vendasta.com">VendAsta</a> we&rsquo;ve been integrating with the <a href="http://stripe.com/checkout">Stripe</a> payment system using Stripe Checkout. The experience has been completely painless and surprisingly simple. Then came a hiccup. While demoing the new functionality we found that one particular computer in the office would open the checkout modal dialog in a new browser window. Just one laptop. It was running the same version of Chrome that we were developing on. It was running the same OS as a working test machine. But the dialog would consistently open in a new browser window on just this one laptop.</p>

<p>After a Friday afternoon debugging session our Product Owner decided to jump onto IRC and chat directly with the Stripe developers. They were quickly able to diagnose our problem: touch. The troublesome laptop was a Windows 8 machine with a touch display — and Stripe Checkout will open in a new browser window when used on a tablet.</p>

<p>This episode was a great reminder of how the first step in debugging is often to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsAssertYourAssumptionsAndDiffYourSourceCode.aspx">find the difference between the working and non-working system</a>. Hopefully this post will help someone else with the same problem.</p>

<p>P.S. Kudos to Stripe for their prompt help via IRC.</p>

                REST was developed and formalized by analyzing the existing Web and extracting the principles that made it work. This set of principles was written down in the Fielding dissertation which lays out the set of constraints that, when enforced, will make a generic network system into a resilient network like the Web. This post examines why REST is important for modern APIs.

                In recent years REST has been at the forefront of modern API design. This has led to APIs with manageable URLs that respect the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and the rest), producing an intuitive model for client developers. Unfortunately, there are two problems that REST doesn&#39;t solve alone.

                One of the first steps in selling a new product or service is finding your target market and one of the best ways of finding your target market is by defining your ideal customer. Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to. Let&#39;s go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.

                I recently received the good news that my business idea was accepted for the University of Saskatchewan&#39;s 2014 Tech Venture Challenge. The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge.

                <p>I wanted to set up a Vagrant instance with node.js and some specific packages pre-installed. I found a Chef cookbook to install node and after a bit of work have a cookbook that will install arbitrary node packages through npm.  I based this heavily on <a href="https://github.com/balbeko/chef-npm">balbeko</a>&rsquo;s chef-npm cookbook with modifications to accept a data bag list of npm packages. Any packages in this list will be installed by Chef.</p>

                <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9pmPa_KxsAM">Google I/O keynote</a> unveiled some new features in Music, Maps and Search. But to me the biggest and most important announcement was the new <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/googles-new-google-photo-features-15gb-full-size-storage-auto-highlight-auto-enhance-more/">Google+ photo features</a>. Full-size high-resolution photos, automatic highlights of entire albums, automatic enhancement and auto-awesome combine to make Google+ <em>the</em> most feature packed photo hosting service on the web. Add the ability to share pictures with anyone via e-mail (take that Facebook) and Google+ is now <em>the</em> best social network to host and share photos.</p>

<p>Why is this important? It encroaches directly on Facebook&rsquo;s bread and butter, sharing pictures. Take a look at the <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats/">statistics</a>. As of May 2013 Facebook hosts 240 billion photos and averages roughly 350 million photo uploads per day. This implies (and my limited anecdotal evidence supports) that most Facebook users view the site as a photo sharing service. If Google can gain mindshare as the premiere social network for sharing photos you may see a large defection users from Facebook.</p>

                <p>No one can question Apple’s dominance in hardware. The build quality and user experience of the iPod, iPhone and iPad positioned Apple as the most profitable company in the world. However, with the build quality of rival devices quickly approaching Apple quality, software will be the next battleground for consumer loyalty. And Apple has a software problem.</p>

<p>The release of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/04/google-now-on-your-iphone-and-ipad-with.html">Google Now</a> for iOS has shown that Google’s software engineering and user interface design can combine to release high quality, functional products surpassing those custom-built by Apple on Apple’s own hardware. Cloud-based mobile apps will continue to gain users and Google’s cloud based offerings are on a completely different level than Apples meagre offerings. In my personal experience Apple’s Reminders App constantly goes out of sync between my iPad and iPhone — with only a simple to-do list on two devices! As more and more data is pushed to the cloud Google’s offerings will continue to outpace what Apple’s — Google has solved so many distributed and cloud computing problems and their infrastructure is not easily replicated.</p>

<p>I have completely replaced Safari with Google Search and Google Chrome, Mail with Gmail, Siri with Google Voice Search, and Google Now is a complete product offering with no answer from Apple. These services work even better with deeper integration and for my next phone I’ll be switching over to Android to gain this integration. As Google Plus and the Google identity layer gain more penetration, more and more people will be using Google products. Imagine a new user with a Google account and a few Google services buying a phone. You can buy Android, sign in once and all your data is exactly where you expect. Or you can buy Apple, download 3 apps, configure the rest to work properly with your existing calendar and hope that everything stays in sync. I know what I do.</p>

                <p>I’m not sure why this was so difficult to discover. For the longest time I was not sure how to create a new file using NERDTree. I finally sat down and figure out how it works.</p>

<p>First, bring up NERDTree and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new file. Press <code>m</code> to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu. This menu allows you to create, rename, and delete files and directories. Type <code>a</code> to add a child node and then simply enter the filename. You’re done! To create a directory follow the same steps but append a <code>/</code> to the filename.</p>

                <p>The latest version of OS X (Mountain Lion) broke compatibility with the vim and the OS clipboard. In most cases you can configure vim to use the operating system clipboard by setting <code>clipboard=unnamed</code> in your <code>.vimrc</code>. Unfortunately this setting does not work in OS X because the default version of vim was not compiled with clipboard support. You can check if your version of vim is compiled with clipboard support by typing <code>vim –version</code>  and looking for <code>clipboard</code>. A prepended <code>+</code> means support is enabled. A prepended <code>–</code> means support is disabled.</p>

<p>So, how do we get clipboard support? By using Macports to install a new version of vim using the <code>huge</code> flag of <code>port install</code>. I also compiled with support for python, ruby, and cscope.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">sudo port install vim huge python ruby cscope
</code></pre>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Prime31&rsquo;s Etcetera plugin for iOS development with Unity3d. There are a lot of great things in there but some of the documentation is lacking.<br />
Anyways, if you want to show a local web page with the <code>showWebPage</code> command it is a two step process.</p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>Copy the files you wish to access into a folder called <code>StreamingAssets</code> under your <code>Assets</code> directory.</p>

<p>Step 2:</p>

<p>Call <code>EtceteraBinding</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>EtceteraBinding.showWebPage(Application.dataPath + &quot;/Raw/FolderWithHTML/index.html&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>FolderWithHTML</code> is the folder you placed in the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder.</p>

                <p>I’ve been getting familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> build tool for <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> but had trouble connecting to the Clojar and Maven repositories behind a proxy.</p>

<p>I ended up adding my proxy to Maven’s <code>settings.xml</code> and everything worked out.</p>

<p>You can find <code>settings.xml</code>  at <code>C:\apache-maven-X.X.X\conf\settings.xml</code>  and can edit it according to the conventions described <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>After editing the file run lein deps  to download your project dependencies. If still can’t connect to the repository servers you may have to copy the <code>settings.xml</code> file to your <code>.m2</code> directory at <code>C:\Documents and Settings\username\.m2\settings.xml</code></p>

              <p>
                <p>I was recently working with the HTML canvas element and wanted to attach an event to the canvas that would fire the click event of a file input element. I would then hide the input element so that the canvas element was the only way to browse for files. My first attempt was simple enough.</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('canvas').onclick = function(e) {
    document.getElementById('filepicker').click();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s time to hide the filepicker input element. Setting the elements style to display: none worked fine with Firefox but Chrome does not allow click events to be fired from hidden HTML elements. The solution is to use a bit of CSS to effectively hide the element. I came across this method over at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html">quirksmode</a> where they use it to style input boxes with CSS. I adapted it to my needs and came up with this solution.</p>

<p>With CSS we set the opacity to <code>0</code> rendering the element invisible. The different declarations are for cross-browser compatibility.</p>

<pre><code>.fakehidden {
    -moz-opacity: 0;
    filter:alpha(opacity: 0);
    opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Setting the input elements class <code>tofakehidden</code> effectively hides the element from the user yet click events can be fired as usual.</p>

              Posted on Wednesday, May 18, 2011 · <a href="http://sookocheff.com/posts/2011-05-18-dissecting-jquerys-fade-animation/#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a>
            </small>
            
              <p>
                <p>Fade animations are a standard tool in any jQuery developer’s toolbox. But how do they really work? Let’s create a small function that encapsulates solely the fade functionality and find out.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the jQuery <code>$</code> idiom.</p>

<pre><code>function $(id) {
    var $ = document.getElementById(id);
    return $;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function takes an HTML id as a parameter and returns the element associated with this id. We can call this function with a string to return the particular element we need.</p>

<pre><code>$('img');
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s add a function to our element.</p>

<pre><code>function $(id) {
    var $ = document.getElementById(id);

    $.fade = function () {
        // perform fade here
    };

    return $;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can call the function by appending <code>.fade</code> to our element.</p>

<pre><code>$('img').fade();
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s set up the rest of the function by adding a parameter for the length of the delay and storing a reference to <code>this</code>. In our context <code>this</code> refers to the element we are calling fade from. (For a detailed explanation of how <code>this</code> is set see the <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com">JavaScript, JavaScript</a> article <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/.../understanding-javascripts-this/">here</a>). Finally, we set the display style of our element to <code>block</code> to ensure our animation is visible.</p>

<pre><code>$.fade = function (delay) {
    var _this = this;

    _this.style.display = 'block';

    // perform fade here
};
</code></pre>

<p>We perform the fade by setting the opacity of our element. For this purpose let’s define a new function for setting the opacity of an element <code>elm</code> to <code>v</code>. We divide by 100 to define our fade in terms of a percentage.</p>

<pre><code>var opacityTo = function (elm, v) {
    elm.style.opacity = v/100;
};
</code></pre>

<p>We can add a call to this function to our fade method.</p>

<pre><code>$.fade = function (delay) {
    var _this = this;

    _this.style.display = 'block';

    // set the opacity to 50%
    opacityTo(_this, 50);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now the trick is to call this function to fade the element over a period of time. We do this by using the <code>setTimeout(callbk, delay)</code> function to set the opacity to different values at particular moments in time. The method signature defines a callbk parameter as a function to call when delay time has passed. If we call this function 100 times throughout our animation we will have a smooth and fluid result.</p>

<p>First we set up the <code>for</code> loop to iterate from 1 to 100 and then call an anonymous function sending the index of our loop as a parameter to the function. Our anonymous function then calls <code>setTimeout</code> periodically (100 times in total).</p>

              <p>
                <p>Developers learn by example. This is no secret. The first advice given to new developers is to read a lot of good source code and the best advice given to experienced developers is to read a lot of good source code. Canonical texts for many languages let the source code say far more than the text. I’m thinking of text’s like <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">Kernighan &amp; Ritchie</a> and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=4825">Friedman &amp; Felleisen</a>.</p>

<p>When the world wide web was in its infancy view source was the best tool for wannabe webmasters learning their craft. Sure, bad designs and bad decisions propagated quickly. But good designs and good decisions propagated too. Those who really wanted to learn found best of breed web sites and quickly copied, edited and pasted their way to a beautiful site, learning much about web design in the process.</p>

<p>I would argue that JavaScript is still in its infancy. Developers are building complex web applications and in the process distilling years of hacking experience in to solid design. And we are hiding all this knowledge from the public for performance gains. The irony is that the JavaScript developers writing the best code are the JavaScript developers that minify. In effect we are hiding the best public source of information on JavaScript web development behind nebulous performance gains.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? Google serves billions of pages a day. Do you?</p>

            <small class="text-muted">
              Posted on Friday, May 6, 2011 · <a href="http://sookocheff.com/posts/2011-05-06-how-to-display-html5-notifications/#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a>

              <p>
                <p>Chrome recently introduced support for HTML Notifications.</p>

<p>Following the brief tutorial at <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/notifications/quick/">HTML5 Rocks</a> I was able to implement this in a matter of minutes and I couldn’t be happier with the results.</p>

<p>The first step towards implementation is to check if the Notifications API is implemented by the browser. We do this by checking for the existence of the webkitNotifications object.</p>

<pre><code>// check for notifications support
if (!window.webkitNotifications) {
    alert('Your browser does not support the Notifications API');
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a means of preventing unwanted notifications we request permission from the user before displaying anything. The method <code>webkitNotifications.checkPermission()</code> will return zero if permission has previously been granted. If it returns non-zero we can request permission with the method <code>webkitNotifications.requestPermission()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// request permission to use notifications
  if (window.webkitNotifications) {
    if (window.webkitNotifications.checkPermission() &gt; 0) {
            window.webkitNotifications.requestPermission();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have requested permission we can display our notification. We use the function <code>webkitNotifications.createNotification()</code> to create a Notification object. This function takes three parameters: an icon to display, a title and text. We then call the <code>show()</code> method on our Notification object to display our notification.</p>

<pre><code>// display a notification
if (window.webkitNotifications &amp;&amp; window.webkitNotifications.checkPermission() == 0) {
    window.webkitNotifications.createNotification(
        'apple-touch-icon.png',
        'Awesome!',
        &quot;You've completed a Pomodoro!&quot;).show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Notifications specification is currently in Draft format and has been submitted to the HTML working group for standardization. You can see the current spec through the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/desktop-notifications/api-specification">Chromium documentation</a>.</p>

              Posted on Wednesday, April 20, 2011 · <a href="http://sookocheff.com/posts/2011-04-20-constants-in-javascript/#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a>

              <p>
                <p>How are constants declared in JavaScript?</p>

<p>You could use the const keyword like so.</p>

<pre><code>const pi = 3.14;
document.writeln(&quot;pi is roughly&quot;   pi   &quot;.&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>But watch out!  The MDN’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">JavaScript Reference</a> says that</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>const</code> is a <strong>Mozilla-specific extension</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Constants are actually not part of the JavaScript specification and we’ll have to roll our own solution.  We could use the <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/">module  pattern</a> and create accessor functions to our constant data like this.</p>

<pre><code>var CONSTANTS = (function() {
  var private = {
    'PI' : '3.14',
  };

  return {
    get: function(name) { return private[name]; }
  };
})();

alert('PI: '   CONSTANTS.get('PI'));
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents write access to our data and allows read access through a bit of extra syntax.  Another method is to simply use a convention such as ALL CAPS to define constants. Most programmers know this convention and will respect it.</p>

<pre><code>var PI = 3.14;
</code></pre>

<p>The solution I use is to place all constants in an object literal.</p>

<pre><code>var CONSTANTS = {
  pi : 3.14
};
</code></pre>

<p>This strikes me as a good compromise between the ALL CAPS convention and the over engineered module pattern solution.  What do you think?</p>

              <p>
                <p>I recently started using Posterous and will be converting my WordPress blog to the service.  One thing I wanted was a custom subdomain (i.e., blog.kevinsookocheff.com); I couldn’t easily find clear instructions for  subdomains (just for domains) so I thought I’d share how I did it from a basic cPanel hosting environment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to your cPanel account.</li>
<li>Under the Domains heading, select Simple DNS Zone Editor.</li>
<li>Select your domain from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Under Add a CNAME Record fill in the following (using blog here as your subdomain).

<ol>
<li>Name: blog</li>
<li>CNAME: posterous.com</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Click the button to Add CNAME Record.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will have to wait a few hours for the change to propagate.  Then navigate to yoursubdomain.domain.com.  You will end up at a posterous.com 404 page.  This is because Posterous does not know to link your subdomain to your Posterous yet. Head over to posterous.com and log in.  From here click on your site settings link and enter yoursubdomain.domain.com as the custom domain for you Posterous.</p>

                <p>This morning I noticed that hovering over links in IE 9 causes slight mouse lag on low-powered computers.  The culprit?  A pop-up notification at the bottom left of the window displaying the link target.  The fix?  Permanently display the Status bar by right-clicking an open space to the right of the New tab button, and selecting Status bar.</p>

<p>Most computers would laugh at the prospect of rendering this insignificant detail but this otherwise lovely MSI Wind Nettop 100 couldn’t handle it.  Now it can.</p>

<li>Pick a task.</li>
<li>Work for 25 minutes. No interruptions.</li>
<li>Take a 5 minute break.</li>
<li>Repeat until the task is finished.</li>
</ol>

<p>It really is that simple! I’ve been using this technique for a while now and although it takes discipline I’ve found that I’m able to maintain sustained productivity throughout the day especially during heavy computer use. Taking periodic breaks to stretch my body and rest my eyes is a simple and effective way to avoid burnout.</p>

                WordPress&#39; new TwentyTen theme is terrific. Well supported, highly modifiable, and with tons of widgets to get the exact layout you desire right out of the box. However, one thing I didn’t like too much was having a big header image on the page. I’m a bit of a minimalist so I wanted to trim down the theme by removing the banner image and the navigation bar. Here&#39;s how I did it.

              <p>
                <p>The future of mobile development is cross-platform HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.  Let me explain. I’ve been working on a couple Windows Phone 7 applications to accompany my first release, <a href="http://www.appsfuze.com/applications/windowsphone.photo/faceart,3617">FaceArt</a>, in the Marketplace. As I do more research and development with the mobile platform I keep looking for ways to increase the reach of my apps. The most obvious is to release Android and iOS versions but I have a few hurdles to clear first, the biggest being lack of time. I do all development as a moonlighting gig while I work full-time and I’m already struggling to find extra hours during the week to finish my first three applications for one platform. How am I going to write and maintain three separate codebases for each app for the major mobile platforms while still keeping my employer happy during the work week?  The solution is cross-platform libraries targeting mobile and web apps. <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>, <a href="http://www.airplaysdk.com">AirPlay</a>, and <a href="http://www.dragonfiresdk.com">DragonFire SDK</a> are a few notable products designed for just this problem.  The most notable, and most intriguing for me, is PhoneGap. I first noticed PhoneGap through an article on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/introducing-the-ars-technica-reader-for-ipad.ars">ArsTechnica</a>. This open-source solution wraps apps designed with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS in a container suitable for the respective app stores. Why is this exciting? You can design an application for the web and get the mobile app for free (or minimal) time investment.  This is as close to the write once, run anywhere ideal that we will get for mobile phones and as the tools improve the experience is only going to get better for developers.  I personally can’t wait to see what the future holds for this product. What do you think?</p>

                In order to have a home server you need the server.  That is, you need the hardware.  You could probably find all sorts of information comparing performance, power consumption, and cost for an assortment of different parts (check tomshardware.com or do some intense).  Or, you can trust that I’ve done my research and go with the same setup as me.

                <p>Google gets it. I recently switched to Google Chrome as my primary web browser and will stick with it for one essential reason.  Speed.  Application launch speed, page loading speed, Javascript speed.  Just plain old speed. When a user opens a browser they are usually expecting to do a few things at the top of their priority list.  Check e-mail, maybe Facebook, check the news headlines and get out. In Firefox there is a significant delay between clicking on the app icon and actually beginning to browse the web.  With Chrome, application launch is almost instantaneous and the difference in user experience is immediately noticeable.  This is a huge win for me and I imagine it will be a huge win for other users who give Chrome a try. Google spends a huge amount of resources in creating efficient algorithms with minimal HTML and Javascript for their flagship products: the search engine, Gmail, and Google Docs.  This attention to efficiency is also paying dividends with Google Chrome and we will continue to see the same gains with Google Chrome OS and Android. Google gets it.</p>

                To use Ubuntu as an audio production server you need the real-time kernel. This allows applications to have some guarantee of the maximum response time of any task. High priority tasks are given the CPU within a fixed minimum amount of time allowing for processor intensive tasks to actually be completed. Follow along to see how to install the real-time kernel yourself. A vanilla install of most Linux distributions does not enable the real-time kernel, but it is easy enough to install.

                I bought a used Delta 44 soundcard with the intention of recording my guitar playing. Pairing this with Rockit 5 powered monitors, a Mackie 802-VLZ3 mixer and the classic Shure SM57 microphone made for a good quality, inexpensive home studio. Using the PCI-based Delta 44 meant that any old computer would work and my idea was to use vanilla Ubuntu and install the Ardour digital audio workstation to push costs even further down. So far so good. Now the only issue is getting everything up and running. Ubuntu is a fairly mature distribution; you can expect a certain level of quality with each release. Unfortunately, this has not been the case with PulseAudio. I won’t go into details; suffice it to say it had a tumultuous upbringing and many of the kinks have since been worked out. Anyways, I quickly discovered that PulseAudio does not recognize the Delta 44. Don’t worry, this is a known problem and a workaround exists. Finding the workaround, however, did take some time.

                According to Wikipedia, readability is defined as reading ease, especially as it results from a writing style.  Only experience, practice, and hard work can improve a person’s writing style.  Let’s increase readability in a different manner: with typography.

                I recently moved all of our household music to a shared network drive and was looking for a solution to stream these libraries as distinct entities; I wanted to keep my wife’s library separate mostly so I could keep all of my painstakingly catalouged music organized exactly how I like it. I was already using mt-daapd, now known as the Firefly Media Server, to stream my own library from my Linux server. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support streaming two libraries from one program instance. The solution to this is to run two copies of mt-daapd and configure them to play nice with each other. Don’t worry, it’s not quite as difficult as it sounds. The first thing you’ll need is to have a separate configuration file for the second daap instance. The easiest way to do this is to copy the files from an existing installation.

                I recently set up a RAID array wanted to keep notified of any errors that may occur. By default Ubuntu Server sends mail to the root user whenever an error occurs but logging in as root to check mail every so often didn’t seem very convenient. There had to be a better way. The best information that I found came from the Ubuntu community forums. Here I’ll expand on that discussion, hopefully helping other people who are trying to do the same thing. The traditional way to forward mail is to create a .forward file in your home directory, entering the addresses that you would like to forward mail to.
