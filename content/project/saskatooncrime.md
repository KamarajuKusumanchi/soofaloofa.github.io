Inspired by the [recent](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/crime-rates-down-in-saskatoon-still-second-highest-in-canada-1.2715889) [reports](http://www.thestarphoenix.com/life/Saskatoon+Canada+highest+crime+rate+victim+success+says+Atchison/11233864/story.html) of Saskatoon having the highest crime rate in Canada, I decided to create a quick visualization of the neighbourhoods most affected by crime in the city.
