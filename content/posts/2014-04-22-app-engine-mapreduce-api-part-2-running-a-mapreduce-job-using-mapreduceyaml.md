[Last time](http://sookocheff.com/posts/2014-04-15-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-1-the-basics/) we looked at an overview of how MapReduce works. In this article we'll be getting our hands dirty writing some code to handle the Map Stage. If you'll recall, the Map Stage is composed of two separate components: an InputReader and a `map` function. We'll look at each of these in turn.

## Getting Started: Installation

First, let's install the MapReduce API for Python. The API is constantly changing so the best way to install the latest version is to checkout the code directly from the [SVN repository](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/).

```bash
svn checkout http://appengine-mapreduce.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/src/mapreduce
```

Place the `mapreduce` folder into your application root directory and add the mapreduce handler to your `app.yaml` file.

```yaml
includes:
- lib/mapreduce/include.yaml

handlers:
- url: /_ah/pipeline.*
  script: mapreduce.lib.pipeline.handlers._APP
  login: admin
```

You can verify your installation by going to the `/mapreduce` URL in your app. You'll see a UI listing the status of any MapReduce jobs. You'll also see a notice that the UI could not find the file `mapreduce.yaml`. You can ignore that notice for now.

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/could-not-find-mapreduce.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/could-not-find-mapreduce.png" alt="Could not find mapreduce.yaml">
</a>

To get a proper view of the data you will also need to add two indexes to your `index.yaml` file to allow the MapReduce library to query for MapReduce jobs that are run via Pipelines and display them in the GUI.

```yaml
indexes:
- kind: _AE_Pipeline_Record
  properties:
  - name: is_root_pipeline
  - name: start_time
    direction: desc
- kind: _AE_Pipeline_Record
  properties:
  - name: class_path
  - name: start_time
    direction: desc
```

## Running Your First MapReduce Job

The easiest way to get started with MapReduce is to use the `mapreduce.yaml` file. This file allows you define a `mapper` function that will be executed for each entity passed to it. Let's go straight to an example and  create a `mapreduce.yaml` file (in your applications root directory) that will iterate over all entities of a certain Kind and put them to the datastore (updating their timestamp).

```yaml
mapreduce:
- name: Touch all entity_kind Models
  mapper:
    input_reader: mapreduce.input_readers.DatastoreInputReader
    handler: path_to_my.touch
    params:
    - name: entity_kind
      default: path_to_my.MyModel
```

Go to the `/mapreduce` URL in your app and you should see the *Touch all entity_kind Models* job selectable under the Launch job setting. 

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/select-first-mapreduce.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/select-first-mapreduce.png" alt="Select first mapreduce to Launch">
</a>

Go ahead and select this job and click `Run`. You will get an error saying that *MyModel* could not be found. 

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/could-not-find-my-model.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/could-not-find-my-model.png" alt="Could not find a Model">
</a>

This is a great time to edit your yaml file point to an actual model in your application to continue with this tutorial. Now that our InputReader is pointing to a model we can define the `map` function specified by our yaml files `handler` parameter. The `map` function is iteratively passed entities from our InputReader and we can take actions on those entities.

```python
def touch(entity):
    """
    Update the entities timestamp.
    """
    entity.put()
 ```
 
Go back to the `/mapreduce` URL in your app and run the job again. Refresh the page (if it does not auto-refresh) and you can see your job running.

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/running-first-job.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/running-first-job.png" alt="Running your first mapreduce job">
</a>

You can click on the `Detail` link to get full details on the MapReduce job. This view gives you the status of individual shards in the MapReduce job and an overview of the processing time that was required.

</a>

We've ran our first MapReduce job!

## The MutationPool

In our `touch` function we put our entity to the datastore once for each entity. This is wasteful when the datastore allows putting multiple items at a time. To take advantage of this feature the MapReduce library offers a MutationPool that collects datastore operations to be performed in batches. 

We can re-write our map function to take advantage of the MutationPool by yielding a database operation from within our map function. If you are unfamiliar with `yield` you can think of it as returning a value to the MapReduce job. You can have multiple `yield` statements in a function that will all return values to be handled by the MapReduce job.

```python
from mapreduce import operation as op

def touch(entity):
    """
    Update the entities timestamp.
    """
    yield op.db.Put(entity)
```
 
 You can run the MapReduce job again and see that the job works correctly using datastore operations via the MutationPool.
 
The source code for MapReduce operations can be found in the `mapreduce.operation` module.  The `mapreduce.operation.db` module currently supports two operations via the MutationPool `Put` and `Delete`.

## Counters

The MapReduce library also provides counters that can be incremented when a condition is met. In our example we can count the number of entities that were touched by incrementing a counter.

```
from mapreduce import operation as op

def touch(entity):
    """
    Update the entities timestamp.
    """
    yield op.db.Put(entity)
    yield op.db.Increment('touched')
 ```
 
 All the counters that were incremented during operation of the job are listed with the job details summary.

</a>
 
## Passing Parameters to the Map Function

We can pass additional parameters to our map function by specifying them in `mapreduce.yaml`. Parameters are passed to both our InputReader and to our map handler function. In our example, we listed `entity_kind` and this parameter was expected by our InputReader and used to specify the datastore Kind processed by our InputReader. On the MapReduce status page (`/mapreduce`) we can type in a new value for this parameter to specify a different Kind before running the job.

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/edit-parameters.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/edit-parameters.png" alt="Editing job parameters">
</a>

Let's add an additional parameter for the map function that will only touch the entity if it is older than a specific date.

```yaml
- name: Touch all entity_kind Models
  mapper:
    input_reader: mapreduce.input_readers.DatastoreInputReader
    handler: app.pipelines.touch
    params:
    - name: entity_kind
      default: app.models.UserModel
    - name: if_older_than
      default:
```

The mapreduce context holds the specifation for the job as defined by the `mapreduce.yaml` file. Within this context we can access our parameters.

```python
from mapreduce import operation as op, context
from datetime import datetime

def touch(entity):
    """
    Update the entities timestamp if not updated since if_older_than.
    """
    params = context.get().mapreduce_spec.mapper.params
    if_older_than = params.get('if_older_than')
    older_than = datetime.strptime(if_older_than, '%b %d %Y') if if_older_than else datetime.now()

    if entity.updated < older_than:
    	yield op.db.Put(entity)
    	yield op.counters.Increment('touched')
```

Now our map function will operate on entities that have been updated previous to our `if_older_than` parameter.

## Parameter Validation

The MapReduce library also provides a method to do parameter validation. In our previous example we passed a date to our map function as a string. We can use a validator to validate that parameter and modify it as necessary. To use a validator function, specify it in `mapreduce.yaml` as `params_validator`.

```
- name: Touch all entity_kind Models
  mapper:
    input_reader: mapreduce.input_readers.DatastoreInputReader
    handler: app.pipelines.touch
    params:
    - name: entity_kind
      default: app.models.UserModel
    - name: if_older_than
      default: Jun 1 2014
    params_validator: app.pipelines.touch_validator
```

The validator function accepts a single argument, a dictionary of parameters. The function can modify this dictionary and any modifications will be made available to the map function. In our example we can use the validator to attempt converting our input date into a datetime object. The `strptime` function returns a `ValueError` if it cannot convert a string to the datetime.

```
def touch_validator(user_params):
    """
    Validate the parameters of our map function.
    """
    if_older_than = user_params['if_older_than']
    datetime.strptime(if_older_than, '%b %d %Y')
```

We can trigger the validator to fail by passing in an invalid date format.

<a class="thumbnail" href="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/failed-validator.png">
<img src="/img/2014-04-22-app-engine-mapreduce-api-part-2-running-a-mapreduce-job-using-mapreduceyaml/failed-validator.png" alt="Passing an invalid paramter">
</a>

If parameter validation fails the MapReduce job is not started and no entities are passed from our InputReader to the map function.  

## Callbacks

The MapReduce library allows you to specify a callback function that is called after the MapReduce completes. This can be used for logging purposes or to trigger a specific event in code. The callback is specified in your `mapreduce.yaml` file as `done_callback` and points to a user specified function. This is a parameter of the MapReduce itself and not the map function -- note the independent entry in `mapreduce.yaml`.

```yaml
- name: Touch all entity_kind Models
  params:
  - name: done_callback
    value: /done_touch
  mapper:
    input_reader: mapreduce.input_readers.DatastoreInputReader
    handler: app.pipelines.touch
    params:
    - name: entity_kind
      default: app.models.UserModel
    - name: if_older_than
      default: Jun 1 2014
    params_validator: app.pipelines.touch_validator
```

Upon completion a POST request is made to the URL given by the `done_callback` parameter. The MapReduce library sets a custom header in this request with the jobs `Mapreduce-Id`. You can use this header to retrieve details on the job that just completed. This is also a great place to do any cleanup such as deleting temporary files. In our example we will just log the original specification for this job that we set via `mapreduce.yaml`

```python
import webapp2
import logging
from mapreduce.model import MapreduceState

class DoneTouch(webapp2.RequestHandler):
    """
    Callback function upon completion of touch MapReduce job.
    """

    def post(self):
        """
        Log the MapReduce ID and input parameters.
        """
        mapreduce_id =  self.request.headers['Mapreduce-Id']           
        state = MapreduceState.get_by_key_name(mapreduce_id)   
        spec = state.mapreduce_spec
        logging.info(spec)
```

## Additional Input Readers

In addition to the DatastoreInputReader the library includes readers for the
Blobstore, Files and Google Cloud Storage Buckets. The documentation for these
readers is scarse but you can consult the `mapreduce.input_readers` module for
more information on the expected parameters for these readers. This information
was gathered from a combination of the offical [Python Users
Guide](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/wiki/UserGuidePython#Specifying_readers)
and from [reading the
source](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-mapreduce/source/browse/trunk/python/src/mapreduce/input_readers.py).
This should give you enough information to get started with the InputReader of
your choice.

## Conclusions

Defining a MapReduce job via `mapreduce.yaml` provides a convenient way to
iterate over large datasets and run a function on each unit of work.
Unfortunately, running a MapDeduce job this way has a few limitations.
First, there is no way to specify a reduce phase, limiting the type of jobs we
can perform. Second, you cannot start a MapReduce job programmatically. 

The next article in this series will show how to overcome these limitations
using MapReduce Pipelines to programmatically control your API.
