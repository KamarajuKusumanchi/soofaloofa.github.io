The recently released [App Engine Modules API](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/modules/) allows developers to compartmentalize their applications into logical units that can share state using the datastore or memcache.

<!--more-->

The documentation for this API is fairly complete but one part is lacking â€” running multiple modules locally using dev_appserver.py. Thankfully, the solution is not too complicated.  Just pass the list of `.yaml` files defining your modules to dev_appserver and it will run all of your modules locally. 

```bash
dev_appserver.py src/app.yaml src/backend.yaml src/dispatch.yaml
```
