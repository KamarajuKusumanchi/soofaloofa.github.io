I recently started using Xubuntu to see if the proclaimed speed differences actually made a difference in productivity. Unfortunately, the Thunar file manager does not automatically recognize network drives so I needed to manually mount SAMBA shares from the command line.  In my searches I stumbled across this [thread][1] giving the exact solution I used.  Hopefully this helps someone else who is having this same problem.
