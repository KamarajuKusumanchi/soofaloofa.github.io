    <h2><a href="/posts/2014-03-25-stripe-checkout-opening-in-a-new-tab">Stripe checkout opening in a new tab</a></h2>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, March 25, 2014.


    </small>

    
      <p>At <a href="http://www.vendasta.com">VendAsta</a> we&#39;ve been integrating with the <a href="http://stripe.com/checkout">Stripe</a> payment system using Stripe Checkout. The experience has been completely painless and surprisingly simple. Then came a hiccup. While demoing the new functionality we found that one particular computer in the office would open the checkout modal dialog in a new browser window. Just one laptop. It was running the same version of Chrome that we were developing on. It was running the same OS as a working test machine. But the dialog would consistently open in a new browser window on just this one laptop. </p>
<p>After a Friday afternoon debugging session our Product Owner decided to jump onto IRC and chat directly with the Stripe developers. They were quickly able to diagnose our problem: touch. The troublesome laptop was a Windows 8 machine with a touch display — and Stripe Checkout will open in a new browser window when used on a tablet.</p>
<p>This episode was a great reminder of how the first step in debugging is often to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsAssertYourAssumptionsAndDiffYourSourceCode.aspx">find the difference between the working and non-working system</a>. Hopefully this post will help someone else with the same problem. </p>
<p>P.S. Kudos to Stripe for their prompt help via IRC.</p>

      Posted on Wednesday, March 19, 2014.


    </small>

    
      <p>
        REST was developed and formalized by analyzing the existing Web and extracting the principles that made it work. This set of principles was written down in the [Fielding dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) which lays out the set of constraints that, when enforced, will make a generic network system into a resilient network like the Web. This post examines why REST is important for modern APIs.

      <p>
        <p>In recent years REST has been at the forefront of modern API design. This has led to APIs with manageable URLs that respect the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">and the rest</a>), producing an intuitive model for client developers. Unfortunately, there are two problems that REST doesn&#39;t solve alone.</p>

      <p>Well the New Year is upon us and I decided to take a fresh approach to this website. I&#39;ve migrated to a new domain and re-written the site from the ground up using <a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve migrated the existing comments (and maybe lost a few) but haven&#39;t bothered to redirect any old posts to their new home. I&#39;m definitely starting fresh!</p>

      <p>
        One of the first steps in selling a new product or service is finding your target market and one of the best ways of finding your target market is by defining your ideal customer. Ask yourself -- out of all the people in the world who would be the most likely to buy this thing? If you can clearly answer this question you have your ideal customer and you can start a marketing campaign targetting exactly the demographic you are trying to sell to. Let's go through an exercise that can help to find that ideal customer by asking three simple questions.

      <p>
        <p>I recently received the good news that my business idea was accepted for the <a href="http://www.usask.ca/research/ilo/business_plan.php">University of Saskatchewan&#39;s 2014 Tech Venture Challenge</a>. The Tech Venture Challenge is a business plan competition for students and alumni where participants are judged by their finished business plan and pitch after a four month workshop program. I&#39;m going to blog about the experience as a way to absorb the material and hopefully help someone else who may be applying in the future. This post will provide some admittedly biased advice on submitting your application to the Tech Venture Challenge.</p>

    </small>

    
      <p>I wanted to set up a Vagrant instance with node.js and some specific packages pre-installed. I found a Chef cookbook to install node and after a bit of work have a cookbook that will install arbitrary node packages through npm.  I based this heavily on <a href="https://github.com/balbeko/chef-npm">balbeko</a>&#39;s chef-npm cookbook with modifications to accept a data bag list of npm packages. Any packages in this list will be installed by Chef.</p>

      Posted on Thursday, May 16, 2013.

      <p>Yesterday&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9pmPa_KxsAM">Google I/O keynote</a> unveiled some new features in Music, Maps and Search. But to me the biggest and most important announcement was the new <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/15/googles-new-google-photo-features-15gb-full-size-storage-auto-highlight-auto-enhance-more/">Google+ photo features</a>. Full-size high-resolution photos, automatic highlights of entire albums, automatic enhancement and auto-awesome combine to make Google+ <em>the</em> most feature packed photo hosting service on the web. Add the ability to share pictures with anyone via e-mail (take that Facebook) and Google+ is now <em>the</em> best social network to host and share photos. </p>
<p>Why is this important? It encroaches directly on Facebook&#39;s bread and butter, sharing pictures. Take a look at the <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-17-amazing-facebook-stats/">statistics</a>. As of May 2013 Facebook hosts 240 billion photos and averages roughly 350 million photo uploads per day. This implies (and my limited anecdotal evidence supports) that most Facebook users view the site as a photo sharing service. If Google can gain mindshare as the premiere social network for sharing photos you may see a large defection users from Facebook. </p>

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Tuesday, April 30, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>No one can question Apple’s dominance in hardware. The build quality and user experience of the iPod, iPhone and iPad positioned Apple as the most profitable company in the world. However, with the build quality of rival devices quickly approaching Apple quality, software will be the next battleground for consumer loyalty. And Apple has a software problem.</p>
<p>The release of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/04/google-now-on-your-iphone-and-ipad-with.html">Google Now</a> for iOS has shown that Google’s software engineering and user interface design can combine to release high quality, functional products surpassing those custom-built by Apple on Apple’s own hardware. Cloud-based mobile apps will continue to gain users and Google’s cloud based offerings are on a completely different level than Apples meagre offerings. In my personal experience Apple’s Reminders App constantly goes out of sync between my iPad and iPhone — with only a simple to-do list on two devices! As more and more data is pushed to the cloud Google’s offerings will continue to outpace what Apple’s — Google has solved so many distributed and cloud computing problems and their infrastructure is not easily replicated.</p>
<p>I have completely replaced Safari with Google Search and Google Chrome, Mail with Gmail, Siri with Google Voice Search, and Google Now is a complete product offering with no answer from Apple. These services work even better with deeper integration and for my next phone I’ll be switching over to Android to gain this integration. As Google Plus and the Google identity layer gain more penetration, more and more people will be using Google products. Imagine a new user with a Google account and a few Google services buying a phone. You can buy Android, sign in once and all your data is exactly where you expect. Or you can buy Apple, download 3 apps, configure the rest to work properly with your existing calendar and hope that everything stays in sync. I know what I do.</p>

    <small class="text-muted">
      Posted on Friday, April 19, 2013.


    </small>

    
      <p>I’m not sure why this was so difficult to discover. For the longest time I was not sure how to create a new file using NERDTree. I finally sat down and figure out how it works.</p>
<p>First, bring up NERDTree and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new file. Press <code>m</code> to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu. This menu allows you to create, rename, and delete files and directories. Type <code>a</code> to add a child node and then simply enter the filename. You’re done! To create a directory follow the same steps but append a <code>/</code> to the filename.</p>
